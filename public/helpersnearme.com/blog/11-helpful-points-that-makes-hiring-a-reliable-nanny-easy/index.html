<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Planning to hire a reliable Nanny for your newborn or growing kids?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here are 11 helpful tips that will make your life easier in 2024.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And if you wish to hire one easily from nearby, follow <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a> now.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>. From time to time, HNM also engages with Government bodies and NGOs to spread the platform&#8217;s accessibility to as many workers all over India as possible.<strong> </strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Planning to hire a Nanny in 2024? </p>



<p>It is an important decision that involves finding someone trustworthy and capable of caring for your most precious possessions – your children. </p>



<p>The process is always quite taxing, but with a little care and these 11 helpful tips, you can ensure a smooth and successful search for a reliable nanny.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">1) Get a legally verified Nanny.</h4>



<p>To ensure that you trust your kids with a good caretaker with a clean and decent background, it is essential to have your Nanny legally verified. </p>



<p>Although 80-90% of the Nannies looking for local employment are genuine.</p>



<p>However, for the balance of 10-20%, getting an exact idea about their IDs, Criminal/Court Records and, at times, their address checks is always essential.</p>



<p>Legally verifying the background is a crucial step to ensure the safety and security of your children.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Helpers Near Me does these background checks legally and with extreme precision. <a href="../../verifications.html">HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process</a> to verify the credentials of the nannies and other domestic workers. </p>



<p>So, mothers can relax knowing that their reliable nanny has a clean background and can be trusted fully.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">2) Hire your reliable nanny from a trusted source. Avoid hiring locally. </h4>



<p>Meet <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a>.</p>



<p>Helpers Near Me helps mothers reduce their worries about finding a reliable nanny nearby.</p>



<p>Learn more <a href="../../about-us.html">about Helpers Near Me</a> and what <a href="../../customer-reviews.html">mothers and parents say about it</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, Helpers Near Me (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire workers near you.</p>



<p>HNM uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with reliable nannies without any middlemen or commissions.</p>



<p>On one end, HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself. </p>



<p>On the other, the digital infrastructure built around HNM makes it easy, quick, reliable &amp; affordable for anyone to find &amp; hire 100+ profiles of nearby workers, including a reliable nanny.</p>



<p>Every Nanny registered with Helpers Near Me is checked thoroughly for their ID and Court/Criminal Records.</p>



<p>Only the ones with a clean background are considered for further recommendations to you.</p>



<p>This works wonderfully for the mothers as they can be assured of getting good nanny caretakers from a trusted source.</p>



<p>Furthermore, hiring a nanny locally is always possible, but it comes with its challenges like </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited choices and flexibility</li>



<li>Lack of proper screening, transparency and documentation</li>



<li>Security concerns are high</li>



<li>Missing reviews and ratings about her</li>



<li>It may become a costly and time-consuming affair</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">3) Consider hiring a nanny with a basic educational background.</h4>



<p>India is a developing country. You may come across many profiles of reliable nannies who are not educated enough. </p>



<p>About 80-90% of the nannies working in India are either uneducated or merely 8/10th pass. And there are varied reasons for this.</p>



<p>However, despite such a situation, it would be nice to find someone with at least some basic reading and writing knowledge or an understanding of the national/regional language.</p>



<p>There are several tasks in the house which require reading and writing.</p>



<p>Also, she should be able to call the relevant people and inform the authorities in emergencies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">4) Prefer a nanny who is clean and hygienic.</h4>



<p>The other thing which is crucial for your child is the nanny&#8217;s health.</p>



<p>And if your child is going to spend around 9-10 hours of his/her day with the nanny, ideally, she should have very high standards of hygiene and sanitation.</p>



<p>So, before hiring a reliable nanny, ensure she knows how to maintain hygiene.</p>



<p>Her hair should be properly tied, and her nails should be neatly cut.</p>



<p>Also, try to gauge if she has a habit of washing her hands before starting work.</p>



<p>Ensuring the hygiene of everyone around a child is a basic necessity that keeps your child protected from any possible illness or viruses.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">5) Gather a little information on the nanny&#8217;s family background. It helps.</h4>



<p>Workers come from different backgrounds and face different challenges in life, many of which we can&#8217;t even think of.</p>



<p>In such a situation, if you know, just a little more about the person you are hiring as a nanny for your child goes a long way.</p>



<p>First, it helps you know the nanny better.</p>



<p>Second, it helps you bridge the gaps between the lifestyles because when a nanny stays at your place the whole day, one must accommodate and understand your home&#8217;s nuances.</p>



<p>Lastly, it helps the nanny establish a comfortable relationship with you as her employer because then she can freely discuss the issues &amp; challenges she may go through in her life while attending to your child.</p>



<p>Although, it can get a little difficult to find out her family&#8217;s background.</p>



<p>But you can at least try to make some normal inquiries about the number of family members &#8211; the husband, father, his work, mother, siblings, the native village/town, her children (if any), etc.</p>



<p>This would help you have a better understanding of her background.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">6) Clarify the monthly salary, work schedules, leaves, and days off (and exceptions as well).</h4>



<p>Before hiring, take enough time to define your needs and expectations clearly. </p>



<p>Consider your child&#8217;s age, specific care requirements, and any household duties you&#8217;d like the nanny to handle. </p>



<p>Accordingly, define the responsibilities, work schedules, leaves and days off.</p>



<p>Likewise, define the monthly salary clearly. After all, money is the main reason a person will show interest in working as a nanny at your place.</p>



<p>A clear understanding of your expectations will help you make the other person understand it effectively.</p>



<p>Sometimes, parents do not bother to clarify the tasks to the nanny. Such ambiguity creates confusion later.</p>



<p>Of course, after a couple of weeks, when the Nanny settles in at your place, you can adjust as per each other&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>Furthermore, always allow your Nanny a little leeway on things &#8211; for example, 15-30 minutes on time because, just like you, she must complete her work at her home before she rushes to your home.</p>



<p>Your consideration and understanding will ensure that the Nanny performs her duty to the best of her abilities.</p>



<p>Also, the Nanny will need leaves just like you do. </p>



<p>There can always be some family emergency which the Nanny might have to attend to.</p>



<p>And at such times, you would be left with no choice but to take a leave yourself.</p>



<p>Be prepared for such unexpected circumstances beforehand, and don’t panic.</p>



<p>If possible, discuss the issue with the Nanny before hiring her and agree on the maximum number of days you can give her unplanned leaves in a month.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">7) Make schedules and ask her to follow it diligently.</h4>



<p>Define a detailed job description that outlines her responsibilities. </p>



<p>Be specific about your child&#8217;s routines, dietary needs, and other important information. </p>



<p>Such clarity will always serve as a guide for both you and the nanny, ensuring everyone is on the same page.</p>



<p>Emphasize the importance of discipline before you hire the Nanny.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">8) Consider a trial period.</h4>



<p>Consider a trial period before making a long-term commitment to the new nanny.</p>



<p>A brief trial period allows you and the nanny to assess whether the arrangement fits you and her well. </p>



<p>During this period, pay attention to how well the nanny interacts with your child and handles daily responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">9) Help build familiarity and adjustment with your child.</h4>



<p>Even if you have decided to hire a particular Nanny, your child might not like her instantly.</p>



<p>Your kid will always need time to adjust to the new nanny in their lives.</p>



<p>So ask the new nanny to start working a couple of weeks along with you. You help her bridge the gap.</p>



<p>This way, you can supervise her work and ensure your kid gets adjusted to the new nanny in your way and you want it to be.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">10) Trust your new nanny with things.</h4>



<p>Trust is hard to come instantly but is the most important aspect of any kind of work arrangement.</p>



<p>When you hire a Nanny for your kids, you entrust a huge responsibility to her.</p>



<p>Hence, the nanny who does this should be strong, trustworthy, reliable and capable enough.</p>



<p>During your selection process, whatever questions you ask and the discussions you do, you will have to make your judgement.</p>



<p>And when you&#8217;ve hired her, trust her with every responsibility you have given her.</p>



<p>And while you trust, keep a check as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">11) Trust your instincts, always.</h4>



<p>Trust your gut feelings. </p>



<p>If something doesn&#8217;t feel right or you have reservations, take them seriously with your new nanny. </p>



<p>It is important to feel confident in your choice of nanny, as this person will play a significant role in your child&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>Everything mentioned above is on one side, and your instincts are on the other.</p>



<p>Every woman&#8217;s instincts are always very strong. Even if you miss any of the abovementioned aspects, follow your instincts.</p>



<p>Your instincts would lead you to the right judgment and right direction automatically.</p>

<p>Finding a reliable nanny requires time, effort, and careful consideration. </p>

<p>Remember, the right nanny is out there, and with the right approach, you can find the perfect match for your family.</p>

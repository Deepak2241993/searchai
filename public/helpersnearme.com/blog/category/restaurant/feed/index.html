<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Owning a restaurant or a cloud kitchen in a metro city like Delhi NCR is quite an achievement. </p>



<p>And running the restaurant or kitchen successfully is another level of achievement.</p>



<p>As an owner, some of the things you track almost every&nbsp;day are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Serving the best of the foods to your Customers</li>



<li>Enough Customer walk-ins or orders every day</li>



<li>Every Customer to be a &#8216;Happy Customer&#8217;</li>



<li>Having decent ratings for your food &amp; restaurant on your favourite apps</li>



<li>Good online reviews of your restaurant/kitchen</li>



<li>Enough recommendations for your restaurant &amp; food on your social pages</li>



<li>No negative publicity </li>



<li>And a few similar other things</li>
</ul>



<p>You try to ensure your restaurant becomes the talk of the town for its ambience, food, and space where people would want to come &amp; spend some time.</p>



<p>However, in trying to ensure everything works perfectly for your restaurant, there&#8217;s one area of concern, which is always a big challenge for you &amp; your restaurant managers &#8211;<strong> Finding your staff!</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Delivery Boy for Restaurants cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Delivery Boy for Restaurants in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Delivery Boy for a Restaurant varies between ₹12,000 to ₹15,000.</p>



<p>Mostly, they consider the travelling expenses for deliveries as a separate cost, charged over &amp; above their fixed salaries. </p>



<p>However, lately, due to the food delivery apps, their expectations for such deliveries have gone up. Many earn as much as ₹18,000 to ₹20,000 for 12/15 hrs work at these apps.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the Delivery Boy cost near you in 2024? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Having adequate staff for your restaurant is as important as ensuring&nbsp;great food for your Customers. </p>



<p>When everything&#8217;s going right for your restaurant business, you don&#8217;t want your staff to be a concern for you, which, in reality, always is.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Imagine this:</h4>



<p>One beautiful Sunday,&nbsp;you reach your Restaurant. You are looking forward to the evening home deliveries for a pre-booked house party at one of your loyal customers. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ve arrived at your restaurant early to ensure that everything is arranged&nbsp;much in advance so that the food is prepared well and that there&#8217;s no delay in any of the evening deliveries. </p>



<p>And then by mid-afternoon, you get a call from one of your Delivery Boy that he&#8217;s not coming in the evening.</p>



<p>Suddenly, your entire plan &amp; arrangement goes for a toss. </p>



<p>And since your deliveries rely highly on your Delivery Boys, your complete plan goes shaky just because one of the two delivery boys did not turn up.</p>



<p>This could be any of your other staff &#8211; your lead Cook or the Waiter or Manager whose presence ensures that the Orders are furnished.</p>



<p>And this could be any of the days in the life of your restaurant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, in the end, what would you do? How would you solve this immediate problem?</h4>



<p>Here are some of the choices you are left with:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cancel your evening plan so that you can deliver the food yourself.</li>



<li>Call your friend who runs another restaurant in the other part of the city</li>



<li>Ask your manager to find one Delivery Boy asap</li>



<li>Ask your other Staff who would know someone in any other restaurant</li>



<li>Check with your friendly neighbourhood restaurant if he could lend you his Delivery Boy for one evening</li>



<li>You even connect with a few agents or contractors who might help you with a handful of commission</li>
</ol>



<p>No matter your choice, it would still be a temporary fix for your immediate problem. In the end, you would anyway have to fix the problem permanently. </p>



<p>Either you would scold your Delivery Boy who didn&#8217;t turn up, or you would fire him, or you would find an alternative. </p>



<p>And every option would still push you to &#8216;finding an alternative Delivery Boy.&#8217;</p>



<p>And until you have your running restaurant, a problem like this will persist.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you fix this problem so you can focus on what&#8217;s essential for your Customers &amp; Restaurant?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you attend to this problem so that it gets fixed permanently?</h4>

<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions.

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to find reliable Helpers near you?</p>



<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>



<p>Remember the last time you were trying to look for Helpers, what all you have to go through?</p>



<p><strong>FIRST</strong>, you had to ask your neighbours if they knew someone.</p>



<p><strong>SECOND</strong>, you had to leave your requirement with the nearest security guard or worker you had come across.</p>



<p><strong>THIRD</strong>, if you had to reach out to all your friends in a similar nature of a business</p>



<p>And <strong>FOURTH</strong>, despite all this, you had to wait a minimum of a few days until someone showed up.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Helper cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Helper in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Helper is around ₹12,000 to ₹13,000, depending on the Helper profile you are looking for.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the cost of Helpers near you in 2024? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ online Helpers profiles near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>By then, your need for a Helper had become so urgent that you hired the first or second person who met you.</p>



<p>As soon as your problem of finding a reliable Helper was resolved, you did not bother about getting the background verification done for the person you hired.</p>



<p>After a few days, you were okay with his/her work. And that was enough for you to move on with your life.</p>



<p>One day, when the person left again, the whole process had to be repeated.</p>



<p>Come to think about it, this process of &#8220;finding Helpers&#8221; is always taxing and time-consuming.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Meet <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Helpers Near Me</span></a>.</h4>



<p>From now on, you will not have to go through such a detailed process to find a reliable Helper near you.</p>

<p>Just follow these 5 really easy steps in 2024, and you should be able to find multiple online Helpers near you within 5 minutes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">1st Step</span>: Visit <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>, follow the ‘Find &amp; Hire Now’ button and Login</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">2nd Step</span>: Enter the profile of the Helper &amp; Confirm your search location</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">3rd Step</span>: View profiles of multiple Helpers near you, with their ratings, background checks, distance, etc.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">4th Step</span>: Select a Plan, Pay a nominal fee (starting at ₹99 only) and connect with every Helper featured in your search result.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">5th Step</span>: Speak with all of them, meet with whoever you want and hire anyone you like from the list</h4>



<p>Once you’ve hired the Helper of your choice, pay the monthly salary directly to the person, without any commission to any middlemen.</p>



<p>Now, compare this with all the hassle you had to go through when you were looking for a Helper earlier &#8211; a lot of references here &amp; there, a long wait and in the end, only 1-2 Helpers who knock on the door, etc.</p>



<p>On the contrary, if you try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Helpers Near Me</strong></span></a>, you will save all the trouble you had to go through before finding a Helper near you.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring workers locally through referrals or agencies? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">HNM</a> today.</h4>



<p>Hiring workers locally through referrals or agencies is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges. </p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring workers locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of workers. </p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of workers you seek. </p>



<p>You can find workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: If available near your location, you will always find enough options for workers at HNM. </p>



<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire workers locally, there&#8217;s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the workers, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references. </p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a worker with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about worker&#8217;s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire workers locally or through agencies</h4>



<p>Hiring workers locally or through agencies without proper background checks and verifications may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any worker. </p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every worker.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire workers locally, ratings and reviews to assess worker&#8217;s suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire workers locally through referrals or an agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker. </p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the worker you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every worker at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on important factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc. </p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a worker&#8217;s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which eventually will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring workers locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring workers locally through referrals or agencies will always be costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient for you.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a worker. </p>



<p>You can connect with ample nearby profiles, compare the available choices, and contact them at your convenience, eliminating the need for physical visits with everyone or reliance on maid agencies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM will always be cost-effective as you save on the commissions involved while using the middlemen to workers near you.</p>



<p>With HNM, you can do all of this in the comfort of your home using your smartphone.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Owning a restaurant or a cloud kitchen in a metro city is quite an achievement.</p>



<p>And running the restaurant or kitchen successfully is another level of achievement.</p>



<p>As an owner, some of the things you track almost every day are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Serving the best of the foods to your Customers</li>



<li>Enough Customer walk-ins or orders every day</li>



<li>Every Customer to be a ‘Happy Customer’</li>



<li>Having decent ratings for your food &amp; restaurant on your favourite apps</li>



<li>Good online reviews of your restaurant/kitchen</li>



<li>Enough recommendations for your restaurant &amp; food on your social pages</li>



<li>No negative publicity</li>



<li>And a few similar other things</li>
</ul>



<p>You try to ensure your restaurant becomes the talk of the town for its ambience, food, and space where people would want to come &amp; spend some time.</p>



<p>However, in trying to ensure everything works perfectly for your restaurant, there’s one area of concern, which is always a big challenge for you &amp; your restaurant managers –<strong>&nbsp;Finding your staff!</strong></p>

<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a good Cook for Restaurants in 2024 varies between ₹18,000 to ₹20,000.</p>



<p>If they are experienced and know how to cook multiple cuisines or are quite good at one cuisine, they may even ask for a salary range of ₹23,000 to ₹25,000.</p>

<p>Having adequate staff for your restaurant is as important as ensuring&nbsp;great food for your Customers.</p>



<p>When everything’s going right for your restaurant business, you don’t want your staff to be a concern for you, which, in reality, always is.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Consider this:</h4>



<p>One beautiful Saturday,&nbsp;you reach your Restaurant.</p>



<p>You are looking forward to the evening party that has been pre-booked at your place.</p>



<p>You’ve arrived at your restaurant early to ensure that everything is arranged&nbsp;much in advance so that nothing goes wrong when your guests arrive in the evening.</p>



<p>And then, within an hour, you get a call from one of your lead cooks that he’s not coming for the day for some valid reason known to him.</p>



<p>Suddenly, your entire plans &amp; arrangements go for a toss.</p>



<p>And since your reliance on your Cook was the highest, your complete plan has gone shaky just because one of the lead staff did not turn up.</p>



<p>This could be your Cook, the Waiter, the Manager or even a Delivery Boy, whose presence ensures that the Delivery Orders are furnished.</p>



<p>This could be any of the days in the life of your restaurant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, in the end, what would you do? How would you solve this immediate problem?</h4>



<p>Here are some of the choices you have:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Call your friend who runs another restaurant/kitchen in the other part of the city</li>



<li>Ask your manager to find one person immediately</li>



<li>Ask your other Cooks who would know someone in any other restaurant</li>



<li>Check with your friendly neighbourhood restaurants if they could lend you their cook for one evening</li>



<li>You even connect with a few agents or contractors who might help you with a handful of commission</li>
</ol>



<p>No matter what choice you opt for, it would still be a temporary fix for the immediate problem you have.</p>



<p>In the end, you would anyway have to fix the problem permanently.</p>



<p>Either you would scold your Restaurant Cook, who didn’t turn up, or you would fire him, or you would find an alternative.</p>



<p>And every option would still push you to find a new Restaurant Cook.</p>



<p>And until you have your running restaurant, a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;like this will persist.</p>



<p>So, how do you fix this problem so you can focus on what’s essential for your Customers and Restaurant?</p>



<p>How do you attend to this problem so that it gets fixed permanently?</p>

<li>Serving the best of the foods to your Customers</li>



<li>Enough Customer walk-ins or orders every day</li>



<li>Every Customer to be a &#8216;Happy Customer&#8217;</li>



<li>Having decent ratings for your food &amp; restaurant on your favourite apps</li>

<li>And a few similar other things</li>
</ul>



<p>You try to ensure your restaurant becomes the talk of the town for its ambience, food, and space where people would want to come &amp; spend some time.</p>



<p>However, in trying to ensure everything works perfectly for your restaurant, there&#8217;s one area of concern, which is always a big challenge for you &amp; your restaurant managers &#8211;<strong> Finding your staff!</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Cook for Restaurant cost in Gurugram in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Cook for Restaurant in Gurugram in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a good Cook for Restaurant in Gurugram in 2024 varies between ₹18,000 to ₹20,000. </p>



<p>If they are experienced and know how to cook multiple cuisines or are quite good at one cuisine, they may even ask for a salary range of ₹23,000 to ₹25,000. </p>



<p>However, the ask and the cooking skills they possess vary from person to person.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Having adequate staff for your restaurant is as important as ensuring&nbsp;great food for your Customers. </p>



<p>When everything&#8217;s going right for your restaurant business, you don&#8217;t want your staff to be a concern for you, which, in reality, always is.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Consider this:</h4>



<p>One beautiful Saturday,&nbsp;you reach your Restaurant. </p>



<p>You are looking forward to the evening party that has been pre-booked at your place. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ve arrived at your restaurant early to ensure that everything is arranged&nbsp;much in advance so that nothing goes wrong when your guests arrive in the evening. </p>



<p>And then, within an hour, you get a call from one of your lead cooks that he&#8217;s not coming for the day for some valid reason known to him.</p>



<p>Suddenly, your entire plans &amp; arrangements go for a toss. </p>



<p>And since your reliance on your Cook was the highest, your complete plan has gone shaky just because one of the lead staff did not turn up.</p>



<p>Now, this could be your Cook, the Waiter, the Manager or even a Delivery Boy, whose presence ensures that the Delivery Orders are furnished.</p>



<p>This could be any of the days in the life of your restaurant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, in the end, what would you do? How would you solve this immediate problem?</h4>



<p>Here are some of the choices you have:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Call your friend who runs another restaurant/kitchen in the other part of the city</li>



<li>Ask your manager to find one person immediately</li>



<li>Ask your other Cooks who would know someone in any other restaurant</li>



<li>Check with your friendly neighbourhood restaurants if they could lend you their cook for one evening</li>



<li>You even connect with a few agents or contractors who might help you with a handful of commission</li>
</ol>



<p>No matter what choice you opt for, it would still be a temporary fix for the immediate problem you have. </p>



<p>In the end, you would anyway have to fix the problem permanently. </p>



<p>Either you would scold your Restaurant Cook, who didn&#8217;t turn up, or you would fire him, or you would find an alternative. </p>



<p>And every option would still push you to find a new Restaurant Cook.</p>



<p>And until you have your running restaurant, a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;like this will persist.</p>



<p>So, how do you fix this problem so you can focus on what&#8217;s essential for your Customers and Restaurant?</p>



<p>How do you attend to this problem so that it gets fixed permanently?</p>

<p>In India, when you are looking for Workers for your home or your workplace or your business, here is the usual process that most of us follow:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>We would first reach out to our close references &#8211; friends, neighbours, colleagues, and whoever else lives close to our home or your workplace </li>



<li>We would then reach out to current workers working at our place and ask them if they are someone who would be interested in the work we have at hand.</li>



<li>And at times when the need is urgent, we even reach out to the agencies and contractors who work as placement agents. </li>
</ol>



<p>Whichever process we follow, in the end, it is either or some of the following:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Long wait</strong> till we end up finding someone</li>



<li><strong>Enough efforts</strong> in reaching out to the close or distant links</li>



<li><strong>Reliance</strong> on individual references and word of mouth</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting a diligent Background Verification of Restaurant Staff is quite challenging.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So how do you verify their credentials?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try the<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications"> Background Verification Services of Helpers Near Me</a> and solve your problem today.</h4>



<p>Have you ever wondered how to go about getting your Restaurant Staff&#8217;s credentials verified?</p>



<p>So whether:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You have a chain of restaurants, or</li>



<li>If you are running just one restaurant setup, or</li>



<li>You have a small hotel &amp; restaurant with about 20-40 staff</li>
</ul>



<p>What you always put at risk is your guests&#8217; valuables.</p>



<p>In reality, not every staff&#8217;s credential is questionable. However, professionally verifying their credentials always ensures a secured system is in place.</p>



<p>This kind of professional background verification of your restaurant staff also ensures the safety of your Guests&#8217; valuables while they are at your restaurant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you go about conducting the background verification of your Restaurant Staff? </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you ensure their credentials gets verified in an absolute professional way?</h4>



<p>Here are some of the options for you:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Get your Restaurant Staff&#8217;s credentials verified at the nearest local police station, or</li>



<li>Get his credentials verified online, in an absolute professional way at <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Option 1 (Recommended): Getting a Police Verification of Restaurant Staffs done at the local police station</h4>



<p>Although this is the usual choice that occurs first to everyone&#8217;s mind, however, accomplishing it for a large or even small number of restaurant staff is not entirely very convenient.</p>



<p>Here are some of the steps involved in Police Verification of Restaurant Staff:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Get a Police Verification form from the local police station (you can even get it online in some cases)</li>



<li>Fill the form for the staff with their full details</li>



<li>Submit the duly filled police verification form at the nearest local police station</li>



<li>At times, if required, even visit the local police station with each of your restaurant staff</li>



<li>Revisit the police station, if some of the documents are not as per the requirements</li>



<li>Picking the stamped copy of the Police Verification Form after a few days</li>
</ol>



<p>In your busy working days, sometimes this seems like a big task.</p>



<p>While you can still send someone from your office to get the necessary paperwork done, yet, this seems more like a task.</p>



<p>And therefore, most often, you never get into it. It just gets ignored in the day-to-day work.</p>



<p>At a national level, it is estimated that only about 10-20% of companies go through the diligent exercise of conducting the Background Verification of Restaurant Staff.</p>



<p>And the rest of the companies take a photocopy of the  Restaurant Staff&#8217;s ID and rely majorly on the reference who referred the  Restaurant Staff.</p>



<p>While taking a copy of ID is easy, but not a safe option.</p>



<p>It is even riskier when you actually loose any of your guests&#8217; valuables.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Option 2 (Easy &amp; Convenient): Verifying the background of your  Restaurant Staff through Helpers Near Me</h4>



<p>To help your company with <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/background-verification-drivers/">Professional Background Verification of  Restaurant Staff</a> here&#8217;s a new initiative from Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p>It is easy, convenient and takes just about 5 minutes for you to place a Verification request.</p>



<p>Plus, it is also easy to pocket – just Rs.199/- per  Restaurant Staff, for the basic option.</p>



<p>And imagine getting a detailed Professional Background Verification Report of your  Restaurant Staff being emailed to you.</p>



<p>The report gets emailed directly to your inbox, within 10-15 Working days.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Isn&#8217;t this as convenient as it could get?</h4>



<p>This Professional Background Verification Report carries the following:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>A professional check on Restaurant Staff&#8217;s ID &#8211; Aadhar ID, Driving License of his Voter ID</li>



<li>A detailed check on Restaurant Staff&#8217;s Criminal/Court Records, if any, in District Courts located in many parts of India, and</li>



<li>If you have opted for this, the report also carries a neighborhood check of his Present or Permanent Address, whether it is in a city like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai or Kolkata, or a village in many parts of India</li>
</ol>



<p>This kind of detailed &amp; Professional Background Verification of Restaurant Staff is something that most of us haven&#8217;t seen or heard of so far.</p>



<p>But yes, it is possible.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to place your request for Background Verification of your Restaurant Staff?</h4>



<p>Here are 3 quick online steps that you need to do for placing a request for Background Verification of your Restaurant Staff. And all of it can be done in just 5 minutes, that too directly through our mobile phone.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">

<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Fill your Staff&#8217;s essential details, if you have if you have it ready with you (Name, Phone, Govt. ID number &amp; Address). Or you can also choose to fill in only your details (Again just your Name, Phone &amp; Email)</li>



<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Make a payment of just Rs.199/- through the secure payment gateway of &#8216;Helpers near me&#8217; (Either through your Paytm Account or by your Credit/Debit Card or Net Banking).</li>
</ol>

<p>For any additional information required during the process, the Helpers Near Me team gets in touch with you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s how the Background Verification conducted at Helpers Near Me</h4>

<p>The partner company is integrated with UIDAI, NSDL, and reliable Government District portals that detail Criminal Cases. These Criminal/Court Records are verified by the company&#8217;s team of legal experts.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Now you can connect with several legally verified Car Drivers near you (Private or Commercial) online in just a few minutes.</h4>

The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/background-verification-drivers/">Verification for Drivers is easy in 2024. You can do it online.</a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>For most of us living in Metro cities, having a Private Car Driver sometimes seems necessary.</p>



<p>Some days, even if you have to travel only a few kilometres, the roads are always so jam-packed that even a half-hour drive takes a minimum of an hour and a half.</p>



<p>Especially in the peak morning and evening, managing a bumper-to-bumper drive takes away all your energy and keeps you away from some of the essential things you might have done if you had a driver.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Car Driver cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Car Driver near me in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Car Driver in 2024 varies between ₹17,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the car to drive.</p>



<p>In some cases, the cost of a Car Driver goes as high as ₹22,000 to ₹25,000, especially if he&#8217;s driving an automatic luxury car or if he&#8217;s driving the car for an Expat.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the cost of a Car Driver near you in 2024? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Driving your car all day and alone is quite a task.</h4>



<p>Here are some of the challenges of driving yourself:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li> Driving through the busy roads, more so at peak times, especially when crossing the city&#8217;s central hub. </li>



<li> Managing bumper-to-bumper drive every day, morning &amp; evening. </li>



<li>Where do you park your car when attending multiple meetings at different locations? A parking ticket is less of an issue. The concern always is finding a space.</li>



<li>Safety concerns of valuables like office laptops, mobile phones or shades when you park your car at some corner, where you had to, just because you were running short of time for the meeting</li>



<li>Minimum 1-2 hrs of drive time every day, no matter what city you live in</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just some of the multiple challenges that many of us face.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Having a Private Car Driver solves most of the issues:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>No waiting time</strong> &#8211; You can leave the car anywhere &amp; hop on it somewhere, all because now you have a Driver on call</li>



<li><strong>Finding a parking space</strong> is no longer a concern</li>



<li><strong>Driving through the busy roads</strong> all through the day seems easy</li>



<li>And the best part is that <strong>you get to either work, take essential calls or relax</strong> during those 1-2 hours of drive time</li>
</ul>



<p>By having a private car driver, all your challenges go away. Plus, he&#8217;s always available on call </p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s still one big challenge.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you find Private Car Drivers? </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There aren&#8217;t enough options available when you are looking for permanent car drivers.</h4>



<p><strong>Your 1st thought</strong> is to ask your friend, neighbour, nearest security guard or people working at your place.</p>



<p>Sure, you can find car drivers using this approach. However, it would take at least a week or a few weeks when you find one.</p>



<p>Your <strong>2nd approach</strong> is finding car drivers online or through an app for Drivers. </p>



<p>You may find a few options here as well.</p>



<p>Though these options are those where you get a Driver for the day or a few hours, you pay them hourly.</p>



<p>However, this option doesn&#8217;t work out all the time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you own a car, your need for car drivers is not hourly, but for the one who can work for you permanently.</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring Car Drivers near you locally through referrals? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try&nbsp;<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">HNM</a>&nbsp;today.</h4>



<p>Hiring Car Drivers near you, locally through referrals, is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges.</p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring Car Drivers locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Car Drivers.</p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek.</p>



<p>Whether you need a driver, cook, full-time maid, full-day maid, part-time maid, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: If available near your location, you will always find enough options for Cra Drivers at HNM.</p>



<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire Car Drivers locally, there’s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the Car Driver, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references.</p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a Driver with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about Driver&#8217;s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire Car Drivers locally</h4>



<p>When you hire a Driver near you locally without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any Driver.</p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every Driver.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire Car Drivers locally, ratings and reviews to assess workers’ suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a Driver locally through referrals, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker.</p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the Driver you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every Car Driver at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on essential factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc.</p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a driver&#8217;s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which will eventually help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring Car Drivers locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a Driver locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming and inconvenient.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of maid agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a Car Driver near you.</p>



<p>You can connect with ample nearby Car Drivers, compare the available choices, and contact them at your convenience, eliminating the need for physical visits with everyone or reliance on maid agencies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM will always be cost-effective as you will save on the commissions involved while using the middlemen to hire a Driver near you.</p>



<p>And with HNM, you can do all of this in the comfort of your home by just using your smartphone.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I need a good and reliable Babysitter, but don&#8217;t know where to find one</em>.&#8221; </p>



<p>It is one of the most common situations that many of us go through. </p>



<p>And at this stage, there&#8217;s not much choice that one can find around us.</p>



<p>Some obvious traditional options are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ask the neighbours, friends or family living in the city</li>



<li>Check with your current maid/cook if they know someone</li>



<li>Leave a note with your friend&#8217;s maid.</li>



<li>Or reach out to an agent/maid agency and try our luck.</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Babysitter cost in Delhi in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Babysitter in Delhi?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Babysitter in Delhi in 2024 varies between ₹13,000 and ₹20,000, depending on the profile of the Babysitter/Nanny you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. </p>



<p>For a Babysitter engaged from morning until evening (about 10/12 hrs of work), hiring the Babysitter or Nanny costs between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p>And if she&#8217;s a Live-in Babysitter/Nanny (24 hrs), the cost of hiring the Live-in Babysitter varies between ₹17,000 to ₹20,000. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>It is an entirely different story if you rely on the agents/maid agencies. Many of them turn into a foul experience. </p>



<p>Alternatively, you wait for the rest of the options until someone appears on your doorstep.</p>



<p>It is even more challenging if you want a live-in Babysitter.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you are a working mother, finding a competent and trustworthy babysitter for your baby can become one of the toughest jobs. </p>



<p>As a mother, you want someone good at her work and who can be trusted with the responsibility of the entire house when you are not around. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">No matter the situation, the babysitter must come through a source you can trust. </h4>



<p>The question always is how to find such a trustworthy source. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a real story in brief that explains the concept of <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Helpers Near Me</strong></span></a> better:</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Babysitter-1.jpg" alt="babysitter" class="wp-image-84" /></figure>



<p>Meet Siso, a girl from Jharkhand who came to Delhi in 2015.</p>



<p>She needed a job that could fetch her some money.</p>



<p>Siso wanted to take care of herself and send a few savings to her parents in her village.</p>



<p>She was not a Babysitter by choice. She has always wanted to be a sports athlete and represent her college at the state level.&nbsp;Finally, she wanted to join forces or the police as a career.</p>



<p>But her financial situation at home brought her to Delhi. She had to give up on her career to earn her living &amp; support her parents back home in the village.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Siso came across our representative and registered herself at <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong>.</p>



<p>She did not pay anyone anything to be a part of <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong>. She joined the platform willingly and free of cost.</p>



<p>After a few weeks of joining Helpers Near Me, she got connected to a family in South Delhi, met with them, and finally decided to work there. Currently, she still works with the same family as a Babysitter.</p>



<p>The family was accommodating enough to ensure she studied whenever she had time.</p>



<p>Now, Siso earns her living, sends money to her parents, and prepares for her dream career.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">But<strong> come to think of it:</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Is this the reality for many other Maids, Babysitters or other Workers?</li>



<li>How many babysitters do we know who have a decent family to live with, get some decent money, and are allowed to pursue their careers simultaneously?</li>



<li>Do they all work without the pressure of an Agent and Contractor?</li>



<li>How many get to take their full salary home and not share it with any agents in between?</li>
</ul>



<p>Today, the reality is that many workers end up paying a decent portion of their salary to Agents or Contractors in between.</p>



<p>And this is not just for one month. Many workers get only a portion of their hard-earned salary every month.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to find a Full time or a Part time <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/how-to-find-reliable-maids-near-me/">Maid</a> in Delhi NCR?</p>



<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>



<p>Remember the last time when you were trying to look for a Maid in Delhi NCR?</p>



<p><strong>FIRST</strong>, you had to ask your neighbours if they knew someone.</p>



<p><strong>SECOND</strong>, you had to ask their maids if they knew any other ones looking for work.</p>



<p><strong>THIRD</strong>, you had to leave your requirement with the nearest security guard you had come across.</p>



<p>And <strong>FOURTH</strong>, despite all this, you had to wait a minimum of a few days until someone appeared on your doorstep.</p>



<p>By then, your need for a Maid had become so urgent that you hired the first or the second one who knocked on your door.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Maid cost in Delhi NCR in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Maid in Delhi NCR in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Maid in Delhi NCR in 2024 varies between ₹3,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the profile of the maid you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. For a&nbsp;<strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours</strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>



<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between ₹5,000 to ₹6,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where&nbsp;<strong>you want the Maid to cook at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid range between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores.</p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven’t worked for Expats earlier.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring a Maid in Delhi NCR locally through referrals or maid agencies? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try&nbsp;<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">HNM</a>&nbsp;today.</h4>



<p>Hiring maids locally in Delhi NCR through referrals or maid agencies is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges.</p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring Maids locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Maids.</p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek.</p>



<p>Whether you need a maid, full time maid, full day maid, part time maid, cook, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: You will always find enough options for Maids at HNM if available near your location.</p>



<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire Maids locally, there’s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the Maid, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references.</p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a Maid with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about Maid’s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire Maids locally or through a maid agency</h4>



<p>When you hire a Maid in Delhi NCR locally or through maid agencies, without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any Maid.</p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every Maid.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire Maids locally, ratings and reviews to assess workers’ suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a Maid locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker.</p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the maid you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every Maid at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on essential factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc.</p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a Maid’s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which eventually will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring Maids locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a Maid locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming and inconvenient.</p>

<p>Want to hire a driver who is right for you?</p>



<p>Life is complex for all of us.</p>



<p>There are always situations when you must rely on someone who can take care of the responsibilities in your absence.</p>



<p>So who is the one at your place?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">No matter the situation, your car driver in almost every home often comes across as your best man Friday.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background wp-block-heading">How much does a Driver cost? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Car Driver?</h4>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p><em>&#8220;Did you get your facial done?&nbsp;My beauty parlour owner has a new Beautician who does amazing massage to give your face a real glow.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;I prefer going to my neighbourhood Parlor. The Beautician there takes care of me during waxing.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Ohh, I am always so scared of getting my threading done by someone new. I get it done only by Tina at my Parlor.&nbsp;She does it very nicely and softly.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;I never let anyone touch my hair except Priyanka at my Parlor. She knows my style &amp; choice.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;My Beautician at my Parlour is so much in demand that I always have to make a prior appointment with her. She is the best I have known so far.&#8221;</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">These statements hold much value if you are running your own Beauty Parlour. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Beautician for Beauty Parlour cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Beautician for Beauty Parlour in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Beautician for a Beauty Parlour in 2024 varies between ₹12,000 to ₹15,000 for someone who is either fresher or has little experience. </p>



<p>However, in cases where the Beauticians have decent years of experience, they can charge a monthly salary of up to ₹20,000 to ₹23,000.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the Beautician cost near you in 2024? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>You can hear statements like the above when a woman starts discussing and talking about her beauty regime. </p>



<p>Every girl and woman is obsessed with her beauty and personal hygiene. </p>



<p>And therefore, they must trust the hands &amp; individuals who work on their bodies.</p>



<p>Consider a teenager going to the parlour for the first time. </p>



<p>Usually, she is a little scared to get her threading done – because she has heard from many of her friends that it hurts a lot. </p>



<p>She is scared to get her waxing done – again, it hurts a lot. In such a case, it is critical that the beautician doing the threading and waxing is good and can develop a comfort zone with the teenage girl.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Similarly, think of a woman who is obsessed with her hair. She would always be very particular about who does her hair.</h4>



<p>In another scenario, even if a woman wants to get her facial done and feels relaxed during her beauty treatment, the Beautician should be an expert to make her feel comfortable and provide her with the best quality massage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">This means only one thing &#8211; your beautician must be an expert and experienced enough to make your Customer feel relaxed &amp; comfortable.</h4>



<p>As a renowned Beauty Parlor Owner among your Customers, even you would have taken a lot of time &amp; effort to build such a relationship with your Customers. </p>



<p>In your initial days, you would have worked as a Beautician to understand every customer&#8217;s needs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And now, when you have a well-established Parlour running in the city&#8217;s heart, how do you ensure you get the best Beautician when you need one?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you ensure you have the best Beauticians for Beauty Parlour?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you find the Beauticians near your Parlour?</h4>



<p>And since you understand the importance of your Customer&#8217;s obsession with their beauty, you know that you need to invest enough time, money &amp; effort with your Beauticians. So that they build on the&nbsp;relationship with your Customer the way you did. </p>



<p>It is equally essential that you put a lot of thought before you hire a new Beautician and give them detailed training before you let them start working on your loyal Customers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">As the Owner of your Parlour, usually, these are the options you try:</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>You put up an Advert in your local newspaper</li>



<li>If you are comfortable online, you can also release ads on some classified websites.</li>



<li>Check with your current Beauticians if they know someone good from around</li>



<li>At times, you even put up a notice in front of your Parlor</li>



<li>Ask your friend who is in a similar line of business.</li>
</ol>



<p>But all these methods are not always foolproof.</p>



<p>The chances are that you may not get any results within the short time that you have in hand. </p>



<p>At times, to fulfil the need, you also get girls with no prior experience but are willing to learn &amp; work. </p>



<p>You take enough pain to train them and wait patiently until they become experts. And then, one fine day, they end up leaving you. And you are again back to square one.</p>



<p>This cycle would continue for as long as you run your Beauty Parlour. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, if the business has to exist, does a reliable source from where you can find Beauticians for Beauty Parlour when you need them?</h4>



<p>Well, from today, here&#8217;s a technology-driven answer to your current problem. </p>



<p>From this day onward, you will not face the same challenge when you need beauticians for your beauty parlour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>If you are looking for a Maid in Gurugram, that too online, chances are that your need is urgent.</h4>
<h4>Try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Helpers near me</span></a> today and save the troubles of running around for finding a Maid.</h4>
<p>Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to find a reliable Maid in Gurugram?</p>
<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>
<p>Remember the last time when you were trying to look for a Maid, what all you had to go through.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you had to ask your neighbors if they know someone.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, you had to ask their maids if she knows any other Maid who is looking for work.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, you had to leave your requirement to the nearest security guard you had come across.</p>
<p>And <strong>fourth</strong>, in spite of all this, you had to wait for a minimum few days till someone showed up on your doorstep.</p>
<p>By that time, your need for a Maid had become so urgent that you ended up hiring the first or the second one who knocked on your door.</p>
<p>And as soon as your problem of finding a reliable maid in Gurugram got resolved, you did not bother too much about getting the background verification done for the Maid you hired.</p>
<p>After a few days, you were, sort of, okay with her work. And that was enough for you to move on with your life.</p>
<p>Until one day, when she left again and the whole process gets repeated for the next Maid.</p>
<p>Come to think about it, this whole process of &#8220;finding a maid&#8221; is always taxing and more so very time-consuming.</p>
<h4>Meet <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Helpers near me</span></a>.</h4>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-812 alignleft" src="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Helpers-near-me-Mobile-223x300.png" alt="" width="265" height="357" /></p>
<p>From today, you would not have to go through such a detailed process to find a reliable Maid in Gurugram.</p>
<p>Just follow these 5 really easy online steps, and you should be able to find multiple Maids in Gurugram, all near you, and within 5 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step<strong> 1: Visit <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Helpers near me</span></a> </strong></h4>
<p><strong>&#8216;Helpers near me&#8217;</strong> makes it very easy for you to find a Maid near you. It helps you connect with multiple Maids near your search location, that too within 5 minutes. It also helps you find many other Helpers listed on the platform &#8211; like Babysitter, Cook, Driver, Mali, etc.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Enter your search keyword and submit your request</h4>
<p>Search keywords like House Cleaning Maid, Full-time Maid, Part-time Maid, Babysitter, Cook or whoever else you might be looking for.</p>
<p>The App would automatically fetch you relevant keywords based on what you type.</p>
<p>Over here you also have the option to refer to the detailed list of Helpers available on the platform. &#8216;<strong>Helpers near me&#8217;</strong> lists about 75+ different kinds of Helpers who work in Domestic or a Workplace environment.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Confirm your location</h4>
<p><strong>&#8216;Helpers near me&#8217;</strong> automatically detects your current location, however, if you want the App to help you find a Maid in any other location, you may have to feed the place manually.</p>
<p>In case if you are using the website for this, you may have to feed in the area manually.</p>
<p>Once you confirm the location, the Apps would automatically search for Maids around your neighborhood and show you the available results.</p>
<p>The results would appear like: &#8220;We can connect you to 8 House Cleaning Maids (7 within 1-km radius &amp; 1 from beyond)</p>
<h4>Step 4: Press &#8220;Connect&#8221; or &#8220;Preview your Active Contacts.&#8221;</h4>
<p>Over here you would have an option of checking the search results before you make the payment.</p>
<p>You can see all the details about the Maids that the App has searched for you &#8211; like Age, Experience, Address, ID and also their different rating based on your need.</p>
<p>Once you hit the &#8220;Connect&#8221; button, the App would reflect a nominal fee for connecting with Maids near you.</p>
<p>The fee is usually less than Rs.500/-. The App again asks you to hit the &#8220;Connect&#8221; button for the next step.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Pay &amp; Get the Contacts of Maids near you</h4>
<p>Here you would have an option of making the online payment through your Credit or Debit Card, Net Banking or your Paytm account.</p>
<p>Once you have paid the amount, the App automatically gives you the details of all the 8 Maids. The particulars capture their Names, Phone numbers, Age, Address, ID details, etc.</p>
<h4>Now, this may seem like a lot of words, but in reality, all of this happens very swiftly. Within 5 minutes, you get the list of Maids near you.</h4>
<p>Now, compare this with all the hassle you had to go through when you were looking for a Maid earlier &#8211; a lot of references here &amp; there, long wait and in the end only 1-2 Maids who knock the door, etc.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if you try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Helpers near me</strong></span></a>, you would save all the trouble you had to go through before finding a Maid near you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a brilliant solution.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">With <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>, find a good home cook near you today.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>. From time to time, HNM also engages with Government bodies and NGOs to spread the platform&#8217;s accessibility to as many workers all over India as possible.<strong> </strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p><em>“Mumma, I want to eat pizza today.” </em></p>



<p><em>“Mumma, I don’t like the baigan ki sabzi, I want noodles.” </em></p>



<p><em>“We have guests for dinner tonight, kuch acchae dishes bana dena.” </em></p>



<p><em>“Aaj nashte mein we want something spicy and crispy. Could you please make some Pakodas &amp; Kachoris?</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Isn’t this similar to your daily food demands at home?</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background wp-block-heading">How much does a Cook cost in Delhi NCR? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Cook in Delhi NCR?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Cook in Delhi NCR varies between ₹7,500 to ₹10,000 for cooking 3 meals for an average family of 4 members. </p>



<p>They usually prefer coming twice a day – once in the morning for breakfast &amp; lunch and again in the evening for Dinner.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background wp-block-heading">Do you want to check the Cook cost near you? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>So, whether you are a Working Mother or a Housewife, free or dead tired, and whether you cook Traditional Indian or Chinese well, the demands and choices for food at home never stop.</p>



<p>Ask any woman today.</p>



<p>Whether you are staying in a joint family or staying alone with your small family, when it comes to the idea of a vacation, our immediate reply comes out as –</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;We need the vacation&nbsp;to get a leave from the kitchen &amp; cooking for a while.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Many might think of this thought as a bit exaggerated.</p>



<p>Or some might shrug it off with humour.</p>



<p>But in reality, it is one of the most tiresome and stressful domestic tasks that a woman goes through three times a day and every day.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A woman like yourself has to juggle many other things in life:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Taking care of your children,</li>



<li>Ensuring your In-Laws needs are met if they are staying with you,</li>



<li>Your job, if you are working along with</li>



<li>Shopping for groceries,</li>



<li>Managing every day’s laundry, etc.</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with all these other chores, cooking every day thrice becomes a compulsion and, at times, a considerable burden, with no escape.</p>



<p>Not that you don’t like cooking, but doing it every day, along with many other tasks, makes the whole cooking process a job rather than a source of enjoyment of serving good food to the family.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In such times, having an extra helping hand is a great relief.</h4>



<p>Hiring a good home Cook who could either help in cooking or cook for the family doesn’t seem like a luxury, but a necessity ensuring everything else in life could be taken care of.</p>



<p>Even though we stay in metro cities, our country has traditionally been famous for its talented khansamas, bawarchis, and pundits.</p>



<p>They were called from across the cities to cook delicacies for special occasions.</p>



<p>Plenty of Cooks are available today, but it is difficult to find a person who can understand a family&#8217;s food and taste requirements.</p>



<p>If the Cook treats the house as her own and learns the unique way food could be cooked for the family, it becomes icing on the cake.</p>



<p>And gradually, in such a case, she gradually becomes an integral part of the family.</p>



<p>In most of the metro cities of India today, finding such a home cook is a big challenge.</p>



<p>Most of the “cook hunt” is done by checking with neighbours, friends, relatives or colleagues. And the choice is always limited.</p>



<p>Also, there is no guarantee that the cook matches your family’s expectations – especially of the children.</p>



<p>Or there might be a great cook available in your locality, but you will never know until you find her through different resources.</p>



<p>Thankfully, finding a home cook in Delhi NCR can be solved easily.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meet <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><strong>Helpers Near Me</strong></a>.</h4>



<p>It is an initiative working towards making it easier for You and the Cook to find each other easily &amp; directly.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to find a reliable Maid in Delhi?</p>



<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>



<p>Remember the last time you were trying to look for a Maid, what did you have to go through?</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>, you had to ask your neighbours if they knew someone.</p>



<p><strong>Second</strong>, you had to ask their maids if they knew any other Ones looking for work.</p>



<p><strong>Third</strong>, you had to leave your requirement to the nearest security guard you had come across.</p>



<p>And <strong>fourth</strong>, despite all this, you had to wait a few days till someone showed up on your doorstep.</p>



<p>By then, your need for a Maid had become so urgent that you hired the first or second one who knocked on your door.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background wp-block-heading">How much does a Maid cost? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Maid in any metro city of India?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Maid varies between ₹3,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the profile of the maid you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. For a <strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours</strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>



<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between ₹5,000 to ₹6,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to cook at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid range between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier.</p>

<p>And as soon as your problem of finding a reliable maid in Delhi was resolved, you did not bother too much about getting the background verification done for the Maid you hired.</p>



<p>After a few days, you were sort of okay with her work. And that was enough for you to move on with your life.</p>



<p>One day, when she left again, the whole process gets repeated&nbsp;for the next Maid.</p>



<p>Come to think about it, &#8220;finding a maid&#8221; is always taxing and time-consuming.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Helpers Near Me</span></a>.</h4>

<p>Just follow these 5 really easy steps, and you should be able to find a Maid in Delhi NCR near you within a few minutes.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here’s a true short story that will give you an insight into a Maid’s life and how you can work towards employing a trustworthy maid:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">One fine day:</h4>



<p>“Didi, may I eat two chapatis at your home today?”, 28 years old, Suman asked me one morning.</p>



<p>I was a little surprised but agreed without questioning her back.</p>



<p>I also offered her some pickle and chutney to go with the dry curry she had brought.</p>



<p>Always cheerful and eager, Suman, my maid for the last two months, had never asked for anything to eat while working.</p>



<p>Today was something amiss, and I could feel it.</p>



<p>She somehow gulped down 7-8 morsels when suddenly tears started to roll down her cheeks, and she started crying loudly.</p>



<p>I consoled her and offered her water; finally, she was calmer. I asked her what the matter was.</p>



<p>She was a little hesitant initially, but I kept on probing.</p>



<p>After feeling more comfortable and confident, she shared her entire story with me.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Suman&#8217;s background:</h4>



<p>Married off by the poor father at the tender age of 16 to a distant cousin, Suman had started her married life in a 10&#215;10 feet congested room in the city away from the vast expanses of her native village.</p>



<p>Suman was a bright student, but poverty forced her father to get her married immediately after she completed SSC.</p>



<p>She was the eldest of 3 sisters with 1 brother.</p>



<p>Her husband was 10 years older than her, and after a couple of months of the wedding, Suman realized that he was good for nothing.</p>



<p>He was addicted to smoking and alcohol and his income could hardly pay the monthly room rent.</p>



<p>To add to it, he could never sustain a permanent job anywhere due to his carefree and headstrong attitude.</p>



<p>One year after her wedding, Suman’s remaining dreams and hopes were brutally smashed when her husband physically hit her when she refused to let him have sex with her.</p>



<p>Even after the beatings, he forced himself on Suman. It was the most unbearable pain she had ever experienced in her life.</p>



<p>But more than the physicality of it, it was the emotional trauma that was more difficult to digest for Suman.</p>



<p>The next morning, Suman was out on her feet, searching for work to keep her out of the house as much as possible and help her regain her self-esteem – or whatever remained of it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">10 years later:</h4>



<p>Suman is doing much better for herself.</p>



<p>She has been able to buy a small 400 sq ft flat for herself, has opened a bank account, and also sends some money back home.</p>



<p>Suman has consciously decided not to have any children.</p>



<p>But despite all this, the husband is unchanged. The forced sex, the beatings, and the physical and mental abuse continue forever as if it’s the husband’s birthright.</p>



<p>“<em>Mei mard hu</em>” is the standard explanation.</p>



<p>And however courageous and progressive Suman might get, she will never cross the line with her husband.</p>



<p>Because in our archetypical and feudal society – the husband is the only person who decides a woman&#8217;s identity and worth – even if he is a wife-beating, alcoholic swine.</p>



<p>Suman’s story is not at all unique.</p>



<p>Almost every maid, every helper, and every worker from an economically underprivileged section of society have a similar story to tell.</p>



<p>Poverty, illiteracy, early marriages, alcoholic husbands, huge loans and a society that feeds on the plight of weaker and helpless women is an extremely common scenarios.</p>



<p>And needless to say, women and young girls are the biggest victims of this circle.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">For most of us, having a maid is a big necessity.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And finding a trustworthy maid is like feeling lucky.</h4>



<p>Our house can come to a standstill if our maid is not around.</p>



<p>Yet, at times, knowingly or unknowingly, we sometimes take them for granted.</p>



<p>We criticize if she is late or if she takes an unplanned leave.</p>



<p>Her demand for a pay hike seems high, even if it is just a few hundred extras.</p>



<p>Very few people realize she is already undertaking much more than she can sustain &#8211; physically, emotionally and financially.</p>



<p>Sadly, there is nothing much one can do legally to help such victimized helpless women.</p>



<p>But at least at a personal level, one can do certain small things to reduce their worries.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here are a few things you can do for your Maid which would lead to her becoming a trustworthy one:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><u>Pay Appropriately</u></strong>: Evaluate her work and try to give her the best pay possible. Do not argue if she asks a little more than what you want to pay.</li>



<li><strong><u>Try to understand her life</u></strong>: While interviewing your Maid, try and check if the woman is going through any problems at home. You can then indirectly tell her that she can depend on you if she needs help.</li>



<li><strong><u>Show some faith</u></strong>: Give her confidence and also show some faith. She would give her the best possible input only if she feels that you trust her.</li>



<li><u><strong>Hire her from sources</strong></u><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><u> </u>trying to help them</strong></span>: You may want to try Helpers Near Me. It is a platform where every woman like Suman can find a job without paying any commission to any agent or contractor. It is an initiative trying to organize the life of the underprivileged like Suman.&nbsp;Helpers Near Me&nbsp;empowers them to find a suitable job without falling into the trap of those who misuse their vulnerability.</li>



<li><strong><u>Give her some settling time</u></strong>: Do not expect her to do exactly how you want and then criticize her if she doesn’t comply. The first couple of weeks, guide her, let her know what exactly you want, and then give her time to settle down.</li>



<li><strong><u>Appreciate the good work</u><span style="text-decoration: underline"> she does</span></strong>: Appreciate her for her good work and sometimes give her extra work that falls out of her predefined tasks. Pay her extra for those tasks.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you do just a little, a woman like Suman would do much more for you.</p>



<p>And eventually, you would find a trustworthy maid in your Suman.</p>



<p>A society can only progress if every section is given equal opportunities to grow.</p>



<p>And what better way to ensure that than starting it from your home?</p>

<p>Looking for online police verification or professional background checks for drivers?</p>



<p>Getting background verification checks done for drivers, maids, cooks, or other workers at your place is as challenging as finding them.</p>



<p>Even though the usual offline choice is available, we all typically look for an online option &#8211; an online police verification option or any other professional background check option.</p>



<p>When you get into the available offline option, you often find it quite cumbersome:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you must get a Police Verification Form from the local police station or your society&#8217;s office. In some cities, you can also access an online police verification form. However, the rest of the steps are still offline.</li>



<li>Second, you fill out the form for the Driver with his full detail</li>



<li>Then you go and submit it to the nearest police station, either yourself or ask the Driver to do so</li>



<li>Sometimes, you even have to be physically present with the Driver at the police station.</li>



<li>And if the relevant documents are pending, you may end up visiting there twice</li>



<li>In the end, after a few days, you get the approved &amp; stamped copy of the Police Verification Form for your Driver</li>
</ol>



<p>In our busy lifestyle, this exercise becomes so much of a task that we often never get into it.</p>



<p>Most of us end up avoiding it until we can.</p>



<p>The fact is that only about 10% of us go through the whole exercise of due diligence before we hire the Driver, Maid, or other workers at our place.</p>



<p>And the rest of us take a copy of the individual&#8217;s ID and rely mostly on their reference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>But does an ID copy give you assurance about your Driver&#8217;s past credentials?</li>



<li>Would the reference who got you the Driver or the Maid take his/her guarantee?</li>



<li>Would an ID copy ensure a safe environment for your family at home or while travelling?</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The fact is that in today&#8217;s time, nobody takes anyone&#8217;s guarantee.</h4>



<p>No matter how strong a reference you get, the person would never take a guarantee of the Driver he&#8217;s referred.</p>



<p>People you know may still recommend a driver or a maid. But you can only be truly assured after legally verifying the person&#8217;s credentials.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">9 reasons why it is essential to perform background checks/police verification on Drivers, Maids, Cooks, Babysitters or other Domestic Workers before hiring them:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Safety of your Home and Family</h4>



<p>Your Driver and other domestic workers have direct access to your home, belongings, and family members. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who do not have a history of criminal behaviour, violence, or other activities that could threaten your household&#8217;s safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ensuring the safety of Children and Elderly at home</h4>



<p>If you are hiring a Driver, Maid, Babysitter or Elderly Care attendant to provide care for children, the elderly at home, or individuals with special needs, a background check is crucial. </p>



<p>It helps verify their suitability for the task you are hiring them for.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prevention of Theft and Fraud&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Background checks can help identify workers with a history of theft, fraud, or other dishonest behaviour. </p>



<p>This safeguards your personal belongings, valuables, and financial assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Trust and Peace of Mind</h4>



<p>Knowing that your Driver, Maid, Cook, Babysitter or other domestic worker has undergone a thorough background check can give you peace of mind, allowing you to trust them more easily with your home and family responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Protection of your Privacy</h4>



<p>Your Driver and Domestic Workers often have access to sensitive and private information within your household. </p>



<p>A professional background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who can be trusted to maintain confidentiality and respect your privacy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Personal Reputation</h4>



<p>The behaviour and conduct of your Driver and Domestic Worker can reflect on your family&#8217;s reputation. </p>



<p>Hiring individuals with a positive background can help maintain your family&#8217;s standing in the community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Legal Compliance</h4>



<p>As you may be aware, In India, there are legal recommendations regarding background checks for domestic workers, especially if they work with vulnerable family members such as children or the elderly. </p>



<p>And if you are staying in a gated community, your building admin would have similar compliances. </p>



<p>Conducting background checks ensures that you comply with applicable rules and regulations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Minimizing Liability</h4>



<p>Within your society, you could be liable if your Driver, Maid or other Domestic Worker engages in harmful or illegal activities while under your employ. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps mitigate this risk by demonstrating due diligence in your hiring process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Long-Term Relationship</h4>



<p>If you are considering hiring a Driver, Maid, Cook or Babysitter for a long-term engagement, a professional background check ensures that you are making a sound investment of time &amp; effort in someone who will contribute positively to your household over time.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It would be incorrect to say that every Driver&#8217;s background is stained.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More than 80%-90% of Drivers, Maids, Cooks and other blue-collar workers are genuine people trying to earn a respectful life.</h4>



<p><strong>Helpers Near Me</strong> connects with many such Drivers, Maids, and other Helpers almost daily.</p>



<p>Largely, a considerable percentage of Domestic &amp; Workplace Helpers are genuine.</p>



<p>They all want to work diligently and earn a respectful living.</p>



<p>However, some want to make some quick money or have hidden motives.</p>



<p>And usually, this small set of people stains the entire workers&#8217; community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Getting a proper Police Verification or a Professional Background Verification done for the individual ensures a safe environment for the family.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

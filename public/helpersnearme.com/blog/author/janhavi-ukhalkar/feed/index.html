<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The cities of India have unbelievably transformed themselves.</p>



<p>This&nbsp;change in cities significantly impacts the lives of people living in them.</p>



<p>Living in a city today is more complicated than about 10 years ago.</p>



<p>The regular working hours per day, around 7 hours earlier,&nbsp;have now expanded to 9-10 hours a day.</p>



<p>The population density is also high because many people are coming into cities to settle down.</p>



<p>Enough crowd &amp; traffic on the road has invariably increased the commuting time to and from the place of work.</p>



<p>People spend extended hours in their offices, so the time they spend on themselves &amp; family has reduced greatly.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Full time Maid cost in Delhi in 2024? What is the right salary per month or charge for hiring a Full time Maid in Delhi in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Full time Maid in Delhi in 2024 varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier. </p>



<p>Likewise, Full Day Maids (also referred to as Full time Maids by many of us), who work for about 10-12 hrs, charge between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="as-expected-this-change-has-brought-limitations-on-the-amount-of-time-one-spends-with-self-with-family-friends-relatives">As expected, this change limits how much time one spends with self, family, friends &amp; relatives.</h4>



<p>On top of this, hundreds of household tasks take countless amounts of time.</p>



<p>And especially if you are the lady of the house, you ensure many things almost daily.</p>



<p>Like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Getting a regular house cleaning done,</li>



<li>Ensuring everyone&#8217;s clothes are cleaned and ironed,</li>



<li>Making sure the food gets prepared on time and with enough care,</li>



<li>Taking out some extra time for random household needs,</li>



<li>Full day-long preparation for a party at home in the evening,</li>



<li>Ensuring the elders in the family are attended to, as required,</li>
</ul>



<p>And much more of such everyday needs.</p>



<p>These are all critical&nbsp;&amp; essential tasks but very time-consuming as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-in-your-busy-life-how-do-you-ensure-you-get-everything-done-and-almost-every-day">So, how do you ensure you get everything done in your busy life? And almost every day.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-do-you-ensure-that-you-attend-your-office-every-day-and-yet-your-household-chores-are-well-taken-care-of">How do you ensure that you attend your Office every day and yet your household chores are well taken care of?</h4>



<p>Would it not relieve you significantly if there were extra helping hands to help you with all such tasks?</p>



<p>It sounds impressive on the face of it, although finding such Helping Hands in a city like Delhi has always been a challenge.</p>



<p>Asking the nearest friend and neighbours could only get you a few options in a few days or weeks.</p>

<p>Hiring Full time Maid in Delhi locally through referrals or maid agencies is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges. </p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring full time maids locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Full time Maids to choose from. </p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek. </p>



<p>Whether you need a full time maid, full day maid, part time maid, cook, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>

<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire full time maids locally, there&#8217;s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the full time maid, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references. </p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a full time maid with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about worker&#8217;s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire full time maids locally or through a maid agency</h4>



<p>When you hire a full time maid in Delhi locally or through maid agencies, without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any full time maid. </p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every worker.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire full time maids locally, ratings and reviews to assess worker&#8217;s suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a full time maid locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker. </p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the worker you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every worker at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on important factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc. </p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a worker&#8217;s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which eventually will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring full time maids locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a full time maid locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient for you.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of maid agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a full time maid in Delhi NCR. </p>

<p>Today, a Cook has become an integral part of the lives of working mothers or nuclear families.</p>



<p>A Cook can become a significant lifesaver for students, bachelors or a joint family.</p>



<p>In India, since time immemorial, we have had a tradition where almost every family had a Maharaj  (permanent or occasional) who helped the mothers and women cook.</p>



<p>They used to do many cooking tasks like cutting, chopping, slicing, peeling, etc.</p>



<p>And in some cases, they used to be like the Man-Friday of the house.</p>



<p>Otherwise, all of these are a lot of tasks for the ladies of the house.</p>



<p>But the situation has changed way too much since those days.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>After trying all the options of finding a Maid or a Babysitter, there&#8217;s one last solution that most of us living in Metro cities try &#8211; reaching out to Maid Service Agencies.</p>



<p>And since the need to have a Maid is always urgent, we usually go ahead with the option that opens up in front of us.</p>



<p>So, what do you do when contacting Maid Service Agencies?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you search for &#8216;Maid Service Agency near me&#8217; on the Internet</li>



<li>Or you find the contacts of a few Maid Service Agencies through your references</li>



<li>Next, you call them and let them know&nbsp;your requirement</li>



<li>You ask a few fundamental questions on whether you can rely on them, whether the maids are verified, etc.</li>



<li>And most importantly, you check how long it would take them to help you hire a Maid or a Babysitter through them.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Maid cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Maid in any metro city of India in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Maid in 2024 varies between ₹3,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the profile of the maid you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. For a <strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours</strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>



<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between ₹5,000 to ₹6,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to cook at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid ranges between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid in 2024</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The challenge of finding <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/how-to-find-a-reliable-maid-online/">a reliable Maid</a> is always tough in bigger cities.</p>



<p>Therefore, we don’t dwell much into the details of Maid Service Agencies as long as the problem gets solved for us, in any manner it may be.</p>



<p>Historically, Maid Service Agencies have existed for years in cities.</p>



<p>Even though it costs a few thousand, a few are reasonably good, offer great service, and are recognized by references.</p>



<p>However, many maid service agencies in almost every city of India are not operating legitimately.</p>



<p>No wonder why we keep hearing stories like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The maid ran away with valuables.</li>



<li>The placement agency takes money, but the Maid flees.</li>



<li>A maid service agency duped a doctor in Delhi.</li>



<li>Citizen’s experiences with fake agencies.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are many such stories that we keep hearing from different parts of the cities at different points in time.</p>



<p>These stories have become fairly common now.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you have gone past the stage of finding a maid through a few maid service agencies, there are many further challenges you have to deal with.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Some of the common challenges that we all face with Maid Service Agencies:</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Doubt on their Credibility &amp; Reliability:</strong>&nbsp;Some of the common questions in your mind are &#8211; How credible is the Maid Service Agency that you are dealing with? Will the maid service agency ensure you get a reliable Maid? Can the Agent guarantee a safe recruit? Is it possible that the Maid Service Agency shares the past credentials of the maid you hired? Would the Agency be there to help you if you face any problems?</li>



<li><strong>Questionable transparency Issues:</strong> Will the Maid Service agency be entirely transparent in its procedures? Will they share all the details of the Maid in absolute transparency?</li>



<li><strong>And how do they treat the Maids? </strong>Does the Maid Service Agency treat their Maids with respect? How are they connected with the Maids? Are the Maids working with the agency willingly, or have they been forced to do the job of a Maid out of some liability or any hidden reason? Are the Maids being treated as Working Professionals?</li>



<li><strong>Uncertain financial transactions:</strong> Would the Maid Service Agency give the Maid the right amount of monthly salary? Would they provide the full amount you give them, or would they charge a hefty commission from her monthly salary? We often hear stories where the agencies charge exorbitant amounts of money from the customers but pay the maids in peanuts.</li>



<li><strong>And finally, the reliability of the Maids?</strong> It is very natural to be concerned about the Maid’s reliability. Since the Maid will be with your family, children &amp; elders for a long period and will have access to the entire house, the new person must be reliable enough, and we know her background in as much detail as possible.</li>
</ol>



<p>These challenges are always there, many before hiring a Maid and a few after.</p>



<p>Some of the doubts get answered; for the rest, we all take some risks and move on.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you find a Maid if you are not getting one easily?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is there any way to ensure the Maid Service Agency you are in touch with is legitimate?</h4>



<p>How can you ensure the Maid Service Agency does every bit of transaction diligently, deals with the Maids correctly, and is entirely transparent in dealing with you?</p>



<p>When dealing with a Maid Service Agency, most questions remain unanswered.</p>



<p>However, the problem of finding a Maid does get answered in the easiest way possible.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Today, a Cook has become an integral part of the lives of working mothers or nuclear families.</p>



<p>A Cook can become a significant lifesaver even for students, bachelors or a joint family.</p>



<p>In India, since time immemorial, we have had a tradition where every family had a Maharaj who helped the mothers and women cook.</p>



<p>They used to do many other cooking tasks, like cutting, chopping, slicing, peeling, etc.</p>



<p>Otherwise, this is quite a lot of work for the woman of the house.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring a Cook in Delhi locally through referrals or maid agencies? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">HNM</a> today.</h4>



<p>Hiring Cooks in Delhi, locally through referrals or maid agencies, is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges.</p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring Cooks in Delhi locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Cooks.</p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek.</p>



<p>Whether you need a cook, full time maid, full day maid, part time maid, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>

<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire Cooks in Delhi locally, there’s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the Cook, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references.</p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a Cook with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about Cook’s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire Cooks in Delhi locally or through a maid agency</h4>



<p>When you hire a Cook in Delhi, locally or through maid agencies, without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any Cook.</p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every Cook.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire Cooks in Delhi locally, ratings and reviews to assess workers’ suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a Cook in Delhi locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker.</p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the cook you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every Cook at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on essential factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc.</p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a Cook&#8217;s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which eventually will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring Cooks in Delhi locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a Cook in Delhi locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming and inconvenient.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of maid agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a Cook near you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Planning to hire a reliable Nanny for your newborn or growing kids?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here are 11 helpful tips that will make your life easier in 2024.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And if you wish to hire one easily from nearby, follow <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a> now.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>. From time to time, HNM also engages with Government bodies and NGOs to spread the platform&#8217;s accessibility to as many workers all over India as possible.<strong> </strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Planning to hire a Nanny in 2024? </p>



<p>It is an important decision that involves finding someone trustworthy and capable of caring for your most precious possessions – your children. </p>



<p>The process is always quite taxing, but with a little care and these 11 helpful tips, you can ensure a smooth and successful search for a reliable nanny.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">1) Get a legally verified Nanny.</h4>



<p>To ensure that you trust your kids with a good caretaker with a clean and decent background, it is essential to have your Nanny legally verified. </p>



<p>Although 80-90% of the Nannies looking for local employment are genuine.</p>



<p>However, for the balance of 10-20%, getting an exact idea about their IDs, Criminal/Court Records and, at times, their address checks is always essential.</p>



<p>Legally verifying the background is a crucial step to ensure the safety and security of your children.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Helpers Near Me does these background checks legally and with extreme precision. <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process</a> to verify the credentials of the nannies and other domestic workers. </p>



<p>So, mothers can relax knowing that their reliable nanny has a clean background and can be trusted fully.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">2) Hire your reliable nanny from a trusted source. Avoid hiring locally. </h4>



<p>Meet <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>.</p>



<p>Helpers Near Me helps mothers reduce their worries about finding a reliable nanny nearby.</p>



<p>Learn more <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/about-us">about Helpers Near Me</a> and what <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/customer-reviews">mothers and parents say about it</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, Helpers Near Me (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire workers near you.</p>



<p>HNM uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with reliable nannies without any middlemen or commissions.</p>



<p>On one end, HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself. </p>



<p>On the other, the digital infrastructure built around HNM makes it easy, quick, reliable &amp; affordable for anyone to find &amp; hire 100+ profiles of nearby workers, including a reliable nanny.</p>



<p>Every Nanny registered with Helpers Near Me is checked thoroughly for their ID and Court/Criminal Records.</p>



<p>Only the ones with a clean background are considered for further recommendations to you.</p>



<p>This works wonderfully for the mothers as they can be assured of getting good nanny caretakers from a trusted source.</p>



<p>Furthermore, hiring a nanny locally is always possible, but it comes with its challenges like </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limited choices and flexibility</li>



<li>Lack of proper screening, transparency and documentation</li>



<li>Security concerns are high</li>



<li>Missing reviews and ratings about her</li>



<li>It may become a costly and time-consuming affair</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">3) Consider hiring a nanny with a basic educational background.</h4>



<p>India is a developing country. You may come across many profiles of reliable nannies who are not educated enough. </p>



<p>About 80-90% of the nannies working in India are either uneducated or merely 8/10th pass. And there are varied reasons for this.</p>



<p>However, despite such a situation, it would be nice to find someone with at least some basic reading and writing knowledge or an understanding of the national/regional language.</p>



<p>There are several tasks in the house which require reading and writing.</p>



<p>Also, she should be able to call the relevant people and inform the authorities in emergencies.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">4) Prefer a nanny who is clean and hygienic.</h4>



<p>The other thing which is crucial for your child is the nanny&#8217;s health.</p>



<p>And if your child is going to spend around 9-10 hours of his/her day with the nanny, ideally, she should have very high standards of hygiene and sanitation.</p>



<p>So, before hiring a reliable nanny, ensure she knows how to maintain hygiene.</p>



<p>Her hair should be properly tied, and her nails should be neatly cut.</p>



<p>Also, try to gauge if she has a habit of washing her hands before starting work.</p>



<p>Ensuring the hygiene of everyone around a child is a basic necessity that keeps your child protected from any possible illness or viruses.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">5) Gather a little information on the nanny&#8217;s family background. It helps.</h4>



<p>Workers come from different backgrounds and face different challenges in life, many of which we can&#8217;t even think of.</p>



<p>In such a situation, if you know, just a little more about the person you are hiring as a nanny for your child goes a long way.</p>



<p>First, it helps you know the nanny better.</p>



<p>Second, it helps you bridge the gaps between the lifestyles because when a nanny stays at your place the whole day, one must accommodate and understand your home&#8217;s nuances.</p>



<p>Lastly, it helps the nanny establish a comfortable relationship with you as her employer because then she can freely discuss the issues &amp; challenges she may go through in her life while attending to your child.</p>



<p>Although, it can get a little difficult to find out her family&#8217;s background.</p>



<p>But you can at least try to make some normal inquiries about the number of family members &#8211; the husband, father, his work, mother, siblings, the native village/town, her children (if any), etc.</p>



<p>This would help you have a better understanding of her background.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">6) Clarify the monthly salary, work schedules, leaves, and days off (and exceptions as well).</h4>



<p>Before hiring, take enough time to define your needs and expectations clearly. </p>



<p>Consider your child&#8217;s age, specific care requirements, and any household duties you&#8217;d like the nanny to handle. </p>



<p>Accordingly, define the responsibilities, work schedules, leaves and days off.</p>



<p>Likewise, define the monthly salary clearly. After all, money is the main reason a person will show interest in working as a nanny at your place.</p>



<p>A clear understanding of your expectations will help you make the other person understand it effectively.</p>



<p>Sometimes, parents do not bother to clarify the tasks to the nanny. Such ambiguity creates confusion later.</p>



<p>Of course, after a couple of weeks, when the Nanny settles in at your place, you can adjust as per each other&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>Furthermore, always allow your Nanny a little leeway on things &#8211; for example, 15-30 minutes on time because, just like you, she must complete her work at her home before she rushes to your home.</p>



<p>Your consideration and understanding will ensure that the Nanny performs her duty to the best of her abilities.</p>



<p>Also, the Nanny will need leaves just like you do. </p>



<p>There can always be some family emergency which the Nanny might have to attend to.</p>



<p>And at such times, you would be left with no choice but to take a leave yourself.</p>



<p>Be prepared for such unexpected circumstances beforehand, and don’t panic.</p>



<p>If possible, discuss the issue with the Nanny before hiring her and agree on the maximum number of days you can give her unplanned leaves in a month.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">7) Make schedules and ask her to follow it diligently.</h4>



<p>Define a detailed job description that outlines her responsibilities. </p>



<p>Be specific about your child&#8217;s routines, dietary needs, and other important information. </p>



<p>Such clarity will always serve as a guide for both you and the nanny, ensuring everyone is on the same page.</p>



<p>Emphasize the importance of discipline before you hire the Nanny.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">8) Consider a trial period.</h4>



<p>Consider a trial period before making a long-term commitment to the new nanny.</p>



<p>A brief trial period allows you and the nanny to assess whether the arrangement fits you and her well. </p>



<p>During this period, pay attention to how well the nanny interacts with your child and handles daily responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">9) Help build familiarity and adjustment with your child.</h4>



<p>Even if you have decided to hire a particular Nanny, your child might not like her instantly.</p>



<p>Your kid will always need time to adjust to the new nanny in their lives.</p>



<p>So ask the new nanny to start working a couple of weeks along with you. You help her bridge the gap.</p>



<p>This way, you can supervise her work and ensure your kid gets adjusted to the new nanny in your way and you want it to be.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">10) Trust your new nanny with things.</h4>



<p>Trust is hard to come instantly but is the most important aspect of any kind of work arrangement.</p>



<p>When you hire a Nanny for your kids, you entrust a huge responsibility to her.</p>



<p>Hence, the nanny who does this should be strong, trustworthy, reliable and capable enough.</p>



<p>During your selection process, whatever questions you ask and the discussions you do, you will have to make your judgement.</p>



<p>And when you&#8217;ve hired her, trust her with every responsibility you have given her.</p>



<p>And while you trust, keep a check as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background">11) Trust your instincts, always.</h4>



<p>Trust your gut feelings. </p>



<p>If something doesn&#8217;t feel right or you have reservations, take them seriously with your new nanny. </p>



<p>It is important to feel confident in your choice of nanny, as this person will play a significant role in your child&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>Everything mentioned above is on one side, and your instincts are on the other.</p>



<p>Every woman&#8217;s instincts are always very strong. Even if you miss any of the abovementioned aspects, follow your instincts.</p>



<p>Your instincts would lead you to the right judgment and right direction automatically.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Finding a reliable nanny requires time, effort, and careful consideration. </p>



<p>By following these helpful tips, you can confidently navigate the hiring process, ultimately securing a trustworthy caregiver who will contribute positively to your child&#8217;s growth and well-being. </p>



<p>Remember, the right nanny is out there, and with the right approach, you can find the perfect match for your family.</p>

<p>A trustworthy maid &#8211; Before you get to that, have you ever wondered about the problems a maid usually goes through?</p>



<p>Once the maid is at your home, she takes care of all your household chores almost daily, but how often do you handle her problems?</p>



<p>Sure, we are all very busy with our own lives, and yes, we do pay them for their work, but for once, if you could just read her life in detail, you would realize that life isn’t as bad for you.</p>

<h4 class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background wp-block-heading">How much does a Maid cost? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Maid in any metro city of India?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Maid varies between ₹3,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the profile of the maid you hire.</p>

<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between ₹5,000 to ₹6,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to cook at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid range between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here’s a true short story that will give you an insight into a Maid’s life and how you can work towards employing a trustworthy maid:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">One fine day:</h4>



<p>“Didi, may I eat two chapatis at your home today?”, 28 years old, Suman asked me one morning.</p>



<p>I was a little surprised but agreed without questioning her back.</p>



<p>I also offered her some pickle and chutney to go with the dry curry she had brought.</p>



<p>Always cheerful and eager, Suman, my maid for the last two months, had never asked for anything to eat while working.</p>



<p>Today was something amiss, and I could feel it.</p>



<p>She somehow gulped down 7-8 morsels when suddenly tears started to roll down her cheeks, and she started crying loudly.</p>



<p>I consoled her and offered her water; finally, she was calmer. I asked her what the matter was.</p>



<p>She was a little hesitant initially, but I kept on probing.</p>



<p>After feeling more comfortable and confident, she shared her entire story with me.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Suman&#8217;s background:</h4>



<p>Married off by the poor father at the tender age of 16 to a distant cousin, Suman had started her married life in a 10&#215;10 feet congested room in the city away from the vast expanses of her native village.</p>



<p>Suman was a bright student, but poverty forced her father to get her married immediately after she completed SSC.</p>



<p>She was the eldest of 3 sisters with 1 brother.</p>



<p>Her husband was 10 years older than her, and after a couple of months of the wedding, Suman realized that he was good for nothing.</p>



<p>He was addicted to smoking and alcohol and his income could hardly pay the monthly room rent.</p>



<p>To add to it, he could never sustain a permanent job anywhere due to his carefree and headstrong attitude.</p>



<p>One year after her wedding, Suman’s remaining dreams and hopes were brutally smashed when her husband physically hit her when she refused to let him have sex with her.</p>



<p>Even after the beatings, he forced himself on Suman. It was the most unbearable pain she had ever experienced in her life.</p>



<p>But more than the physicality of it, it was the emotional trauma that was more difficult to digest for Suman.</p>



<p>The next morning, Suman was out on her feet, searching for work to keep her out of the house as much as possible and help her regain her self-esteem – or whatever remained of it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">10 years later:</h4>



<p>Suman is doing much better for herself.</p>



<p>She has been able to buy a small 400 sq ft flat for herself, has opened a bank account, and also sends some money back home.</p>



<p>Suman has consciously decided not to have any children.</p>



<p>But despite all this, the husband is unchanged. The forced sex, the beatings, and the physical and mental abuse continue forever as if it’s the husband’s birthright.</p>



<p>“<em>Mei mard hu</em>” is the standard explanation.</p>



<p>And however courageous and progressive Suman might get, she will never cross the line with her husband.</p>



<p>Because in our archetypical and feudal society – the husband is the only person who decides a woman&#8217;s identity and worth – even if he is a wife-beating, alcoholic swine.</p>



<p>Suman’s story is not at all unique.</p>



<p>Almost every maid, every helper, and every worker from an economically underprivileged section of society have a similar story to tell.</p>



<p>Poverty, illiteracy, early marriages, alcoholic husbands, huge loans and a society that feeds on the plight of weaker and helpless women is an extremely common scenarios.</p>



<p>And needless to say, women and young girls are the biggest victims of this circle.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">For most of us, having a maid is a big necessity.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And finding a trustworthy maid is like feeling lucky.</h4>



<p>Our house can come to a standstill if our maid is not around.</p>



<p>Yet, at times, knowingly or unknowingly, we sometimes take them for granted.</p>



<p>We criticize if she is late or if she takes an unplanned leave.</p>



<p>Her demand for a pay hike seems high, even if it is just a few hundred extras.</p>



<p>Very few people realize she is already undertaking much more than she can sustain &#8211; physically, emotionally and financially.</p>



<p>Sadly, there is nothing much one can do legally to help such victimized helpless women.</p>



<p>But at least at a personal level, one can do certain small things to reduce their worries.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here are a few things you can do for your Maid which would lead to her becoming a trustworthy one:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><u>Pay Appropriately</u></strong>: Evaluate her work and try to give her the best pay possible. Do not argue if she asks a little more than what you want to pay.</li>



<li><strong><u>Try to understand her life</u></strong>: While interviewing your Maid, try and check if the woman is going through any problems at home. You can then indirectly tell her that she can depend on you if she needs help.</li>



<li><strong><u>Show some faith</u></strong>: Give her confidence and also show some faith. She would give her the best possible input only if she feels that you trust her.</li>



<li><u><strong>Hire her from sources</strong></u><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><u> </u>trying to help them</strong></span>: You may want to try Helpers Near Me. It is a platform where every woman like Suman can find a job without paying any commission to any agent or contractor. It is an initiative trying to organize the life of the underprivileged like Suman.&nbsp;Helpers Near Me&nbsp;empowers them to find a suitable job without falling into the trap of those who misuse their vulnerability.</li>



<li><strong><u>Give her some settling time</u></strong>: Do not expect her to do exactly how you want and then criticize her if she doesn’t comply. The first couple of weeks, guide her, let her know what exactly you want, and then give her time to settle down.</li>



<li><strong><u>Appreciate the good work</u><span style="text-decoration: underline"> she does</span></strong>: Appreciate her for her good work and sometimes give her extra work that falls out of her predefined tasks. Pay her extra for those tasks.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you do just a little, a woman like Suman would do much more for you.</p>



<p>And eventually, you would find a trustworthy maid in your Suman.</p>



<p>A society can only progress if every section is given equal opportunities to grow.</p>



<p>And what better way to ensure that than starting it from your home?</p>

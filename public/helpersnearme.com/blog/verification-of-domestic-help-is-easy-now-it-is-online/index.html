<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Verification&nbsp;of Domestic Help always seems a complicated task.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It is not anymore in 2024!</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try the <a href="../../verifications.html">Professional Verification Services of Helpers Near Me</a> and save yourself from all the hassle.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Now you can <strong><a href="../../verifications.html">legally verify your Workers/Staff at Helpers Near Me</a></strong>. We follow a 2/3 Step Background Verification Process. <strong>OPTIONS </strong>&#8211; 1) ID Check, which confirms the validity of the govt. ID the individual carries, 2) Court/Criminal Records Check, which scans the court records of the individual at the neighbouring Indian District Courts around his/her present or permanent address, &amp; 3) Address Check, which reports whether the individual stays at the place where one claims to be staying. At HNM, <strong>YOU CAN VERIFY</strong> your Domestic Workers, School Workers, Restaurant Workers, Office Workers, Factory Workers, Hospital Workers, Store Workers and Logistics Workers like Truck Drivers, Loaders, etc.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Accomplishing Background Verification of domestic help like Maids, Cooks, Drivers, Babysitters, Gardeners, and others is as challenging as finding them near you.</p>



<p>The usual offline choices are always available.</p>



<p>However, they seem quite cumbersome when you get into accomplishing them.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you must get a hard copy of the Police Verification Form / Background Verification Form from the local police station. At times, you can also find it at your society&#8217;s admin office. In some cities, you also get the verification form online. However, the rest of the steps are still offline.</li>



<li>Second, you fill out the form for the domestic help with her full detail</li>



<li>Then you go and physically submit it to the nearest police station (or ask her to do so)</li>



<li>At times, you even have to be personally present there with the domestic help at the police station</li>



<li>You may also have to revisit the place if the relevant documents are still pending</li>



<li>In the end, after a few days, you pick up the approved &amp; stamped copy of the Police Verification form of your domestic help.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In our busy lifestyle, this exercise becomes so much of a task that we often never get into it.</h4>



<p>We end up avoiding the verification for maids and other necessary checks until we can.</p>



<p>And it is the same for many of us.</p>



<p>The fact is that before hiring domestic help at our place, only about less than 10% of us go through the whole exercise of getting proper due diligence done.</p>



<p>The rest of us just take a copy of the Maid or Driver&#8217;s ID and rely on their reference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it: How sure are you of your Maid&#8217;s and Driver&#8217;s past if you just rely on the ID copy?</h4>



<p>Would the reference who got you the Maid or the Driver take her/his guarantee?</p>



<p>Can an ID copy ensure a safe environment for your family?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In reality, nobody takes anyone&#8217;s guarantee. And that&#8217;s a fact.</h4>



<p>People may still give you references for Maids or Drivers, but the real assurance would come only after you&#8217;ve professionally verified the person&#8217;s credentials.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">9 reasons why it is essential to perform background checks/police verification for Maids, Cooks, Drivers, Babysitters or other Domestic Workers in 2024 before hiring them:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Safety of your Home and Family</h4>



<p>Domestic workers have direct access to your home, belongings, and family members. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who do not have a history of criminal behaviour, violence, or other activities that could threaten your household&#8217;s safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ensuring the safety of Children and Elderly at home</h4>



<p>If you are hiring a Maid, Babysitter, Driver or Elderly Care attendant to provide care for children, the elderly at home, or individuals with special needs, a background check is crucial. </p>



<p>It helps verify their suitability for the task you are hiring them for.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prevention of Theft and Fraud&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Background checks can help identify workers with a history of theft, fraud, or other dishonest behaviour. </p>



<p>This safeguards your personal belongings, valuables, and financial assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Trust and Peace of Mind</h4>



<p>Knowing that your Maid, Cook, Driver, Babysitter or other domestic worker has undergone a thorough background check can give you peace of mind, allowing you to trust them more easily with your home and family responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Protection of your Privacy</h4>



<p>Domestic Workers often have access to sensitive and private information within your household. </p>



<p>A professional background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who can be trusted to maintain confidentiality and respect your privacy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Personal Reputation</h4>



<p>The behaviour and conduct of your domestic worker can reflect on your family&#8217;s reputation. </p>



<p>Hiring individuals with a positive background can help maintain your family&#8217;s standing in the community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Legal Compliance</h4>



<p>As you may be aware, In India, there are legal recommendations regarding background checks for domestic workers, especially if they work with vulnerable family members such as children or the elderly. </p>



<p>And if you are staying in a gated community, your building admin would have similar compliances. </p>



<p>Conducting background checks ensures that you comply with applicable rules and regulations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Minimizing Liability</h4>



<p>Within your society, you could be liable if your Maid, Driver or other Domestic Worker engages in harmful or illegal activities while under your employ. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps mitigate this risk by demonstrating due diligence in your hiring process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Long-Term Relationship</h4>



<p>If you are considering hiring a Maid, Cook, Babysitter or Driver for a long-term engagement, a professional background check ensures that you are making a sound investment of time &amp; effort in someone who will contribute positively to your household over time.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It would be an injustice to assume that the background of every Maid or Driver is stained. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An estimated 80-90% of Maids, Drivers, Cooks and other Workers are genuine people trying to earn a respectful life.</h4>



<p><strong>Helpers Near Me</strong> connects with several domestic help almost every day.</p>



<p>We can confidently say that a considerable percentage of blue-collar workers are genuine.</p>



<p>They all want to work diligently and earn a respectful living.</p>



<p>However, a few of them want to make some quick money or have hidden motives.</p>



<p>Usually, this small set of workers stains the entire Maids, Drivers, and other workers&#8217; community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Getting a proper Police Verification or Professional Background Verification check done ensures the family is protected &amp; secured in all possible ways.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Here&#8217;s an initiative from Helpers Near Me that will help you with <a href="../../verifications.html">professional background verification</a> for Maids, Drivers, Cooks or other Domestic Workers<strong>. </strong></h4>



<p>The process is as simple as it could get.</p>



<p>This service lets you verify your Maid, Driver or any other blue-collar worker online and in the most convenient way possible.</p>



<p>Imagine getting a detailed Background Verification Report of your Maid or Driver working at your place.</p>



<p>Here are 3 quick steps to follow when you need your Maid&#8217;s Background Verification Report.</p>



<p>And all of this can be done directly through your mobile phones.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">1st Step</span>: Open the <a href="../../verifications.html">Background Verification Application</a> of Helpers Near Me and Select the verification checks you wish to go for.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">2nd Step</span>: Fill in and upload the details of your Domestic Worker (Name, Phone, ID number and Address, if you have any).</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">3rd Step</span>: Make an online payment starting from ₹199.</h4>



<p>That is all it takes.</p>



<p>You must follow the above-mentioned basic steps to initiate your Verification request at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p>Once your request is through, the <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong> team will contact you if further details are required.</p>



<p>Or, if everything required is intact, you may directly get your Maid&#8217;s Background Verification Report in about 7-10 working days.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t even need to go anywhere to pick up the report.</p>



<p>You get a detailed verification of your domestic help directly in your email.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">For every worker, Helpers Near Me follows a stringent <a href="../../verifications.html">2/3-Step Verification Process</a>:</h4>



<p>1)&nbsp;<strong>ID Verification </strong>&#8211; At a basic level, the ID of your Maid is verified through genuine Government sources</p>



<p>2)<strong> Criminal/Court Records Checks </strong>&#8211; In this case, we scan the Criminal/Court Records of the Maid. This check is done through a reliable Government District portal that details Criminal/Court Cases of individuals, if there are any.</p>



<p>3) On a special request, Helpers Near Me also does a <strong>Physical Address Verification</strong> of the individual, which is the <strong>3rd Step</strong>. In this case, a verifier visits the place and verifies the individual&#8217;s address.</p>



<p>Our associate company&#8217;s integration with UIDAI, NSDL, and reliable Government District portals ensures a diligent Background Verification of every individual. </p>



<p>With this kind of professional background verification check, you get transparency into the maid and driver&#8217;s identity, antecedents, and character.</p>



<p>Such a Professional Verification lets you decide on the person you have already hired or are about to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Such professional verification checks ensure a safe environment for your family at home.</h4>



<p>If you still rely on a copy of an ID &amp; some references, we suggest you verify your <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="../5-easy-steps-to-find-a-maid-in-delhi-ncr/index.html">Maid</a></span>, Driver, <a href="../how-to-find-reliable-babysitter-near-me/index.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Nanny</span></a>, <a href="../how-to-find-a-good-salesman-near-me/index.html">Salesman</a> at your store, or other workers today!</p>

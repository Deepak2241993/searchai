For a <strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours<\/strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between \u20b93,000 to \u20b94,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)<\/strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between \u20b95,000 to \u20b96,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to cook at home<\/strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between \u20b97,000 to \u20b99,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)<\/strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid range between \u20b913,000 to \u20b914,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid<\/strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between \u20b917,000 to \u20b918,000.

I asked her what the matter was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was a little hesitant initially, but I kept on probing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After feeling more comfortable and confident, she shared her entire story with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Suman&#8217;s background:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Married off by the poor father at the tender age of 16 to a distant cousin, Suman had started her married life in a 10&#215;10 feet congested room in the city away from the vast expanses of her native village.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suman was a bright student, but poverty forced her father to get her married immediately after she completed SSC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was the eldest of 3 sisters with 1 brother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her husband was 10 years older than her, and after a couple of months of the wedding, Suman realized that he was good for nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was addicted to smoking and alcohol and his income could hardly pay the monthly room rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to it, he could never sustain a permanent job anywhere due to his carefree and headstrong attitude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One year after her wedding, Suman\u2019s remaining dreams and hopes were brutally smashed when her husband physically hit her when she refused to let him have sex with her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after the beatings, he forced himself on Suman. It was the most unbearable pain she had ever experienced in her life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than the physicality of it, it was the emotional trauma that was more difficult to digest for Suman.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning, Suman was out on her feet, searching for work to keep her out of the house as much as possible and help her regain her self-esteem \u2013 or whatever remained of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10 years later:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Suman is doing much better for herself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has been able to buy a small 400 sq ft flat for herself, has opened a bank account, and also sends some money back home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suman has consciously decided not to have any children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite all this, the husband is unchanged. The forced sex, the beatings, and the physical and mental abuse continue forever as if it\u2019s the husband\u2019s birthright.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Mei mard hu<\/em>\u201d is the standard explanation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And however courageous and progressive Suman might get, she will never cross the line with her husband.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because in our archetypical and feudal society \u2013 the husband is the only person who decides a woman&#8217;s identity and worth \u2013 even if he is a wife-beating, alcoholic swine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suman\u2019s story is not at all unique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every maid, every helper, and every worker from an economically underprivileged section of society have a similar story to tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poverty, illiteracy, early marriages, alcoholic husbands, huge loans and a society that feeds on the plight of weaker and helpless women is an extremely common scenarios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And needless to say, women and young girls are the biggest victims of this circle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For most of us, having a maid is a big necessity.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And finding a trustworthy maid is like feeling lucky.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our house can come to a standstill if our maid is not around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, at times, knowingly or unknowingly, we sometimes take them for granted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We criticize if she is late or if she takes an unplanned leave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her demand for a pay hike seems high, even if it is just a few hundred extras.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few people realize she is already undertaking much more than she can sustain &#8211; physically, emotionally and financially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, there is nothing much one can do legally to help such victimized helpless women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at least at a personal level, one can do certain small things to reduce their worries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here are a few things you can do for your Maid which would lead to her becoming a trustworthy one:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><u>Pay Appropriately<\/u><\/strong>: Evaluate her work and try to give her the best pay possible.

You can then indirectly tell her that she can depend on you if she needs help.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><u>Show some faith<\/u><\/strong>: Give her confidence and also show some faith. She would give her the best possible input only if she feels that you trust her.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><u><strong>Hire her from sources<\/strong><\/u><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong><u> <\/u>trying to help them<\/strong><\/span>: You may want to try Helpers Near Me.

The first couple of weeks, guide her, let her know what exactly you want, and then give her time to settle down.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><u>Appreciate the good work<\/u><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"> she does<\/span><\/strong>: Appreciate her for her good work and sometimes give her extra work that falls out of her predefined tasks.

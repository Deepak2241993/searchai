<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Helper App! </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Yes, it is possible to find helpers near you online.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Check <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a> &amp; find it yourself.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>. From time to time, HNM also engages with Government bodies and NGOs to spread the platform&#8217;s accessibility to as many workers all over India as possible.<strong> </strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Helper App! All your doubts about a Helper App are genuine. </p>

<p>Thus far, finding workers through an App would have been beyond one&#8217;s imagination, but here it is. </p>



<p>So you can find them and many more at Helpers Near Me, whether you are looking for Domestic Workers, School Workers, Restaurant Workers, Factory Workers, or Construction Workers.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Helper cost? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Helper?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Helper is around ₹12,000 to ₹13,000, depending on the Helper profile you are looking for.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="../../salary-tracker.html">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the cost of Helpers near you? Try <strong><a href="../../salary-tracker.html">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Helpers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>In India, when you are looking for Workers for your home or your workplace or your business, here is the usual process that most of us follow:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>We would first reach out to our close references &#8211; friends, neighbours, colleagues, and whoever else lives close to our home or your workplace </li>



<li>We would then reach out to current workers working at our place and ask them if they are someone who would be interested in the work we have at hand.</li>



<li>And at times when the need is urgent, we even reach out to the agencies and contractors who work as placement agents. </li>
</ol>



<p>Whichever process we follow, in the end, it is either or some of the following:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Long wait</strong> till we end up finding someone</li>



<li><strong>Enough efforts</strong> in reaching out to the close or distant links</li>



<li><strong>Reliance</strong> on individual references and word of mouth</li>



<li><strong>Pay a huge amount of commission</strong> to the agents/contractors, or</li>



<li>Live with the <strong>issue of managing things somehow till you find someone</strong> </li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it: This whole process of finding a worker is always taxing and time-consuming.</h4>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meet <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a>.</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1st Step: Visit&nbsp;<a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a>, follow the ‘Find &amp; Hire Now’ button and Login</h4>

<p>And once you’ve hired a Helper of your choice, pay the monthly salary directly to the person, without any commission to any middlemen.</p>

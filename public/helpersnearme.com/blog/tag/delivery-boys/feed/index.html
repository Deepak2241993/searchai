<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Owning a restaurant or a cloud kitchen in a metro city like Delhi NCR is quite an achievement. </p>



<p>And running the restaurant or kitchen successfully is another level of achievement.</p>



<p>As an owner, some of the things you track almost every&nbsp;day are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Serving the best of the foods to your Customers</li>



<li>Enough Customer walk-ins or orders every day</li>



<li>Every Customer to be a &#8216;Happy Customer&#8217;</li>



<li>Having decent ratings for your food &amp; restaurant on your favourite apps</li>



<li>Good online reviews of your restaurant/kitchen</li>



<li>Enough recommendations for your restaurant &amp; food on your social pages</li>



<li>No negative publicity </li>



<li>And a few similar other things</li>
</ul>



<p>You try to ensure your restaurant becomes the talk of the town for its ambience, food, and space where people would want to come &amp; spend some time.</p>



<p>However, in trying to ensure everything works perfectly for your restaurant, there&#8217;s one area of concern, which is always a big challenge for you &amp; your restaurant managers &#8211;<strong> Finding your staff!</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Delivery Boy for Restaurants cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Delivery Boy for Restaurants in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Delivery Boy for a Restaurant varies between ₹12,000 to ₹15,000.</p>



<p>Mostly, they consider the travelling expenses for deliveries as a separate cost, charged over &amp; above their fixed salaries. </p>



<p>However, lately, due to the food delivery apps, their expectations for such deliveries have gone up. Many earn as much as ₹18,000 to ₹20,000 for 12/15 hrs work at these apps.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the Delivery Boy cost near you in 2024? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Having adequate staff for your restaurant is as important as ensuring&nbsp;great food for your Customers. </p>



<p>When everything&#8217;s going right for your restaurant business, you don&#8217;t want your staff to be a concern for you, which, in reality, always is.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Imagine this:</h4>



<p>One beautiful Sunday,&nbsp;you reach your Restaurant. You are looking forward to the evening home deliveries for a pre-booked house party at one of your loyal customers. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ve arrived at your restaurant early to ensure that everything is arranged&nbsp;much in advance so that the food is prepared well and that there&#8217;s no delay in any of the evening deliveries. </p>



<p>And then by mid-afternoon, you get a call from one of your Delivery Boy that he&#8217;s not coming in the evening.</p>



<p>Suddenly, your entire plan &amp; arrangement goes for a toss. </p>



<p>And since your deliveries rely highly on your Delivery Boys, your complete plan goes shaky just because one of the two delivery boys did not turn up.</p>



<p>This could be any of your other staff &#8211; your lead Cook or the Waiter or Manager whose presence ensures that the Orders are furnished.</p>



<p>And this could be any of the days in the life of your restaurant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, in the end, what would you do? How would you solve this immediate problem?</h4>



<p>Here are some of the choices you are left with:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cancel your evening plan so that you can deliver the food yourself.</li>



<li>Call your friend who runs another restaurant in the other part of the city</li>



<li>Ask your manager to find one Delivery Boy asap</li>



<li>Ask your other Staff who would know someone in any other restaurant</li>



<li>Check with your friendly neighbourhood restaurant if he could lend you his Delivery Boy for one evening</li>



<li>You even connect with a few agents or contractors who might help you with a handful of commission</li>
</ol>



<p>No matter your choice, it would still be a temporary fix for your immediate problem. In the end, you would anyway have to fix the problem permanently. </p>



<p>Either you would scold your Delivery Boy who didn&#8217;t turn up, or you would fire him, or you would find an alternative. </p>



<p>And every option would still push you to &#8216;finding an alternative Delivery Boy.&#8217;</p>



<p>And until you have your running restaurant, a problem like this will persist.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you fix this problem so you can focus on what&#8217;s essential for your Customers &amp; Restaurant?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you attend to this problem so that it gets fixed permanently?</h4>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Owning a restaurant or a cloud kitchen in a metro city like Noida is quite an achievement. </p>



<p>And running the restaurant or kitchen successfully is another level of achievement.</p>



<p>As an owner, some of the things you track almost every&nbsp;day are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Serving the best of the foods to your Customers</li>



<li>Enough Customer walk-ins or orders every day</li>



<li>Every Customer to be a &#8216;Happy Customer&#8217;</li>

<li>Enough recommendations for your restaurant &amp; food on your social pages</li>



<li>No negative publicity </li>



<li>And a few similar other things</li>
</ul>



<p>You try to ensure your restaurant becomes the talk of the town for its ambience, food, and space where people would want to come &amp; spend some time.</p>



<p>However, in trying to ensure everything works perfectly for your restaurant, there&#8217;s one area of concern, which is always a big challenge for you &amp; your restaurant managers &#8211;<strong> Finding your staff!</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Cook for Restaurant cost in Noida in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Cook for Restaurant in Noida in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a good Cook for Restaurant in Noida in 2024 varies between ₹18,000 to ₹20,000. </p>



<p>If they are experienced and know how to cook multiple cuisines or are quite good at one cuisine, they may even ask for a salary of ₹23,000 to ₹25,000. </p>



<p>However, the ask and the cooking skills they possess vary from person to person.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Having adequate staff for your restaurant is as important as ensuring&nbsp;great food for your Customers. </p>



<p>When everything&#8217;s going right for your restaurant business, you don&#8217;t want your staff to be a concern for you, which, in reality, always is.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Consider this:</h4>



<p>One beautiful Saturday,&nbsp;you reach your Restaurant. </p>



<p>You are looking forward to the evening party that has been pre-booked at your place. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ve arrived at your restaurant early to ensure that everything is arranged&nbsp;much in advance so that nothing goes wrong when your guests arrive in the evening. </p>



<p>And then, within an hour, you get a call from one of your lead cooks that he&#8217;s not coming for the day for some valid reason known to him.</p>



<p>Suddenly, your entire plans &amp; arrangements go for a toss. </p>



<p>And since your reliance on your Cook was the highest, your complete plan has gone shaky just because one of the lead staff did not turn up.</p>



<p>Now, this could be your Cook, the Waiter, the Manager or even a Delivery Boy, whose presence ensures that the Delivery Orders are furnished.</p>



<p>This could be any of the days in the life of your restaurant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, in the end, what would you do? How would you solve this immediate problem?</h4>



<p>Here are some of the choices you have:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Call your friend who runs another restaurant/kitchen in the other part of the city</li>



<li>Ask your manager to find one person immediately</li>



<li>Ask your other Cooks who would know someone in any other restaurant</li>



<li>Check with your friendly neighbourhood restaurants if they could lend you their cook for one evening</li>



<li>You even connect with a few agents or contractors who might help you with a handful of commission</li>
</ol>



<p>No matter what choice you opt for, it would still be a temporary fix for the immediate problem you have. </p>



<p>In the end, you would anyway have to fix the problem permanently. </p>



<p>Either you would scold your Restaurant Cook, who didn&#8217;t turn up, or you would fire him, or you would find an alternative. </p>



<p>And every option would still push you to find a new Restaurant Cook.</p>



<p>And until you have your running restaurant, a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;like this will persist.</p>



<p>So, how do you fix this problem so you can focus on what&#8217;s essential for your Customers and Restaurant?</p>



<p>How do you attend to this problem so that it gets fixed permanently?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting a diligent Background Verification of Restaurant Staff is quite challenging.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So how do you verify their credentials?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try the<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications"> Background Verification Services of Helpers Near Me</a> and solve your problem today.</h4>



<p>Have you ever wondered how to go about getting your Restaurant Staff&#8217;s credentials verified?</p>



<p>So whether:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You have a chain of restaurants, or</li>



<li>If you are running just one restaurant setup, or</li>



<li>You have a small hotel &amp; restaurant with about 20-40 staff</li>
</ul>



<p>What you always put at risk is your guests&#8217; valuables.</p>



<p>In reality, not every staff&#8217;s credential is questionable. However, professionally verifying their credentials always ensures a secured system is in place.</p>



<p>This kind of professional background verification of your restaurant staff also ensures the safety of your Guests&#8217; valuables while they are at your restaurant.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you go about conducting the background verification of your Restaurant Staff? </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you ensure their credentials gets verified in an absolute professional way?</h4>



<p>Here are some of the options for you:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Get your Restaurant Staff&#8217;s credentials verified at the nearest local police station, or</li>



<li>Get his credentials verified online, in an absolute professional way at <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Option 1 (Recommended): Getting a Police Verification of Restaurant Staffs done at the local police station</h4>



<p>Although this is the usual choice that occurs first to everyone&#8217;s mind, however, accomplishing it for a large or even small number of restaurant staff is not entirely very convenient.</p>



<p>Here are some of the steps involved in Police Verification of Restaurant Staff:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Get a Police Verification form from the local police station (you can even get it online in some cases)</li>



<li>Fill the form for the staff with their full details</li>



<li>Submit the duly filled police verification form at the nearest local police station</li>



<li>At times, if required, even visit the local police station with each of your restaurant staff</li>



<li>Revisit the police station, if some of the documents are not as per the requirements</li>



<li>Picking the stamped copy of the Police Verification Form after a few days</li>
</ol>



<p>In your busy working days, sometimes this seems like a big task.</p>



<p>While you can still send someone from your office to get the necessary paperwork done, yet, this seems more like a task.</p>



<p>And therefore, most often, you never get into it. It just gets ignored in the day-to-day work.</p>



<p>At a national level, it is estimated that only about 10-20% of companies go through the diligent exercise of conducting the Background Verification of Restaurant Staff.</p>



<p>And the rest of the companies take a photocopy of the  Restaurant Staff&#8217;s ID and rely majorly on the reference who referred the  Restaurant Staff.</p>



<p>While taking a copy of ID is easy, but not a safe option.</p>



<p>It is even riskier when you actually loose any of your guests&#8217; valuables.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Option 2 (Easy &amp; Convenient): Verifying the background of your  Restaurant Staff through Helpers Near Me</h4>



<p>To help your company with <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/background-verification-drivers/">Professional Background Verification of  Restaurant Staff</a> here&#8217;s a new initiative from Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p>It is easy, convenient and takes just about 5 minutes for you to place a Verification request.</p>



<p>Plus, it is also easy to pocket – just Rs.199/- per  Restaurant Staff, for the basic option.</p>



<p>And imagine getting a detailed Professional Background Verification Report of your  Restaurant Staff being emailed to you.</p>



<p>The report gets emailed directly to your inbox, within 10-15 Working days.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Isn&#8217;t this as convenient as it could get?</h4>



<p>This Professional Background Verification Report carries the following:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>A professional check on Restaurant Staff&#8217;s ID &#8211; Aadhar ID, Driving License of his Voter ID</li>



<li>A detailed check on Restaurant Staff&#8217;s Criminal/Court Records, if any, in District Courts located in many parts of India, and</li>



<li>If you have opted for this, the report also carries a neighborhood check of his Present or Permanent Address, whether it is in a city like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai or Kolkata, or a village in many parts of India</li>
</ol>



<p>This kind of detailed &amp; Professional Background Verification of Restaurant Staff is something that most of us haven&#8217;t seen or heard of so far.</p>



<p>But yes, it is possible.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to place your request for Background Verification of your Restaurant Staff?</h4>



<p>Here are 3 quick online steps that you need to do for placing a request for Background Verification of your Restaurant Staff. And all of it can be done in just 5 minutes, that too directly through our mobile phone.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Visit the Background Verification page at Helpers Near Me or <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">click here</a></li>



<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Fill your Staff&#8217;s essential details, if you have if you have it ready with you (Name, Phone, Govt. ID number &amp; Address). Or you can also choose to fill in only your details (Again just your Name, Phone &amp; Email)</li>



<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Make a payment of just Rs.199/- through the secure payment gateway of &#8216;Helpers near me&#8217; (Either through your Paytm Account or by your Credit/Debit Card or Net Banking).</li>
</ol>



<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>



<p>Once you have initiated your Background Verification request for your Restaurant Staff, you would get a formal report within 7-10 working days of your request, at your email address.</p>



<p>For any additional information required during the process, the Helpers Near Me team gets in touch with you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s how the Background Verification conducted at Helpers Near Me</h4>



<p>The partner company of Helpers Near Me, BetterPlace, conducts the Background Verification of Restaurant Staff.</p>



<p>The partner company is integrated with UIDAI, NSDL, and reliable Government District portals that detail Criminal Cases. These Criminal/Court Records are verified by the company&#8217;s team of legal experts.</p>



<p>The physical Address Verification is done via a network of app-based verifiers across the country.</p>



<p>With such a kind of Professional Background Verification, you get transparency into the Restaurant Staff&#8217;s Identity, Antecedents, and Character.</p>



<p>This kind of verification allows you to make an informed decision on the person you have already hired or are about to hire.</p>



<p>More so, it will enable you to ensure your Customers&#8217; valuable items are safe &amp; secure.</p>



<p>With this new Online Background Verification initiative of Helpers Near Me, you have an option to be 100% sure of the background of your Restaurant Staff.</p>

<p>It is always challenging to find a genuine and good full time maid.</p>



<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>



<p>Looking around, you hardly find any organized source to find full time maids.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sure there are numerous middlemen, agencies and bureaus in between, but hardly anyone you can rely on.</h4>



<p>Recollect the last time you were looking for a full time maid:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Multiple proposals, but none reliable</li><li>Ample promises, but questions on the outcome in the end</li><li>A few thousand upfront charges</li><li>Annual contracts, and</li><li>Personal guarantees</li></ol>



<p>The fact is that despite all the above, there is hardly any assurance that the experience will go smooth.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the shocking stories that you keep hearing in the media.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Visit <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a></span> today. The platform helps you connect with full time maids near you directly.</h4>

<p>And once you have hired someone, pay the monthly salaries directly to the full time maid.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a> and connect with multiple legally pre-verified Part time Maids today.&nbsp;</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Save the trouble of searching for one with references.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions.

From time to time, HNM also engages with Government bodies and NGOs to spread the platform&#8217;s accessibility to as many workers all over India as possible.<strong> </strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>The cities of India have unbelievably transformed themselves.</p>



<p>This&nbsp;change in cities significantly impacts the lives of people living in them.</p>



<p>Living in a city today is more complicated than it was about 10 years ago.</p>



<p>The regular working hours per day, around 7 hours earlier,&nbsp;have now expanded to 9-10 hours a day.</p>



<p>Because many people are coming into cities to settle down, the population density is also high.</p>



<p>Enough crowd &amp; traffic on the road has invariably increased the commuting time to and from the place of work.</p>



<p>People are spending extended hours in their offices, and as a result, the time a person spends on themselves &amp; family has been reduced by a great deal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">As expected, this change has brought limitations on the amount of time one spends with self, family, friends &amp; relatives.</h4>



<p>And on top of this, hundreds of household tasks take&nbsp;countless time.</p>



<p>And especially if you are the lady of the house, you end up ensuring a lot of things almost every day.</p>



<p>Like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Getting a regular house cleaning done,</li>



<li>Ensuring everyone&#8217;s clothes are cleaned and ironed,</li>



<li>Making sure the food gets prepared on time and with enough care,</li>



<li>Taking out some extra time for random household needs,</li>



<li>Full day-long preparation for a party at home in the evening,</li>



<li>Ensuring the elders in the family are attended to, as required,</li>
</ul>



<p>And much more of such everyday needs.</p>



<p>These are all critical&nbsp;&amp; essential tasks, but very time-consuming as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you ensure you get everything done in your busy life every day?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you ensure that you attend your Office every day and yet your household chores are well taken care of?</h4>



<p>Would it not relieve you significantly if there were extra helping hands to help you with all such tasks?</p>



<p>Sounds interesting on the face of it, although finding such Helping Hands in a city like Gurgaon has always been a challenge.</p>



<p>Asking the nearest friend and neighbours could only get you a few options, that too in about a few days or weeks.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meet&nbsp;<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>.</h4>



<p>From today, you would not have to go through such a detailed process to find a Part time Maid in Gurggram.</p>



<p>Follow these 5 simple &amp; easy steps, and you should be able to find a Part time Maid in Gurggram.</p>



<p>Connect with multiple Part time Maids near you within a few minutes and at a fee starting at just Rs.99/-</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1st Step: Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>, follow the ‘Find &amp; Hire Now’ button and Login</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5th Step: Speak with all of them, meet with whoever you want and hire anyone you like from the list</h4>



<p>And once you have hired someone, pay the monthly salary directly to the Part time Maids.</p>



<p>Now, compare this with all the hassle you had to go through when you were looking for a Part time Maid in Gurugram earlier – a lot of references here &amp; there, a long wait and in the end, only 1-2 Maids who knocked on your door, etc.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/verification-for-maids-is-easy-now-its-online/">Verification for Maids is easy in 2024. You can do it online. </a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to find an answer to &#8220;reliable Maids near me&#8221;?</p>



<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>



<p>Remember the last time you were trying to look for a Maid? What did you have to go through?</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>, you had to ask your neighbours if they knew someone.</p>



<p><strong>Second</strong>, you had to ask their maids if they knew any other Maids looking for work.</p>



<p><strong>Third</strong>, you had to leave your requirements with the nearest security guard you had come across.</p>



<p>And <strong>fourth</strong>, despite all this, you had to wait a few days till someone showed up on your doorstep.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Maid cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Maid in any metro city of India in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Maid in 2024 varies between ₹3,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the profile of the maid you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. For a <strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours</strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>



<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between ₹5,000 to ₹6,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to cook at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid range between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>By then, your need for a Maid had become so urgent that you hired the first or second one who knocked on your door.</p>



<p>When your problem of &#8220;finding maids near me&#8221; was resolved, you did not bother about getting the background verification done for the maid you hired.</p>



<p>After a few days, you were sort of okay with her work. And that was enough for you to move on with your life.</p>



<p>When she left again one day, the whole process was repeated&nbsp;for the next Maid.</p>



<p>Come to think about it, this &#8220;finding a maid&#8221; process is always taxing and, more so, very time-consuming.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Meet <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Helpers Near Me</span></a>.</h4>



<p>From today, you will not have to go through such a detailed process to find Maids near you.</p>



<p>Just follow these 3 simple steps, and you should be able to find a Maid near you within 5 minutes.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring a Maid near you locally through referrals or maid agencies? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try&nbsp;<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">HNM</a>&nbsp;today.</h4>



<p>Hiring Maids near you, locally through referrals or maid agencies, is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges.</p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring Maids locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Maids.</p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek.</p>



<p>Whether you need a maid, full time maid, full day maid, part time maid, cook, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: You will always find enough options for Maids at HNM if available near your location.</p>



<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire Maids locally, there’s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the Maid, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references.</p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a Maid with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about Maid’s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire Maids locally or through a maid agency</h4>



<p>When you hire a Maid near you, locally or through maid agencies, without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any Maid.</p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every Maid.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire Maids locally, ratings and reviews to assess workers’ suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a Maid locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker.</p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the maid you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every Maid at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on essential factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc.</p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a Maid’s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which eventually will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring Maids locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a Maid locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming and inconvenient.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of maid agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a Maid near you.</p>



<p>You can connect with ample nearby Maids, compare the available choices, and contact them at your convenience, eliminating the need for physical visits with everyone or reliance on maid agencies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM will always be cost-effective as you will save on the commissions involved while using the middlemen to hire a maid near you.</p>



<p>And with HNM, you can do all of this in the comfort of your home by just using your smartphone.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The cities of India have unbelievably transformed themselves.</p>



<p>This&nbsp;change in cities significantly impacts the lives of people living in them.</p>



<p>Living in a city today is more complicated than about 10 years ago.</p>



<p>The regular working hours per day, around 7 hours earlier,&nbsp;have now expanded to 9-10 hours a day.</p>



<p>The population density is also high because many people are coming into cities to settle down.</p>



<p>Enough crowd &amp; traffic on the road has invariably increased the commuting time to and from the place of work.</p>



<p>People spend extended hours in their offices, and as a result, the time a person spends on themselves &amp; family has been reduced by a great deal.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Full time Maid cost in Gurugram in 2024? What is the right salary per month or charge for hiring a Full time Maid in Gurugram in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Full time Maid in Gurugram in 2024 varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier. </p>



<p>Likewise, Full Day Maids (also referred to as Full time Maids by many of us), who work for about 10-12 hrs, charge between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">As expected, this change has limitations on the time one spends with self, family, friends &amp; relatives.</h4>



<p>On top of this, hundreds of household tasks take countless amounts of time.</p>



<p>And especially if you are the lady of the house, you ensure many things almost daily.</p>



<p>Like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Getting a regular house cleaning done,</li>



<li>Ensuring everyone&#8217;s clothes are cleaned and ironed,</li>



<li>Making sure the food gets prepared on time and with enough care,</li>



<li>Taking out some extra time for random household needs,</li>



<li>Full day-long preparation for a party at home in the evening,</li>



<li>Ensuring the elders in the family are attended to, as required,</li>
</ul>



<p>And much more of such everyday needs.</p>



<p>These are all critical&nbsp;&amp; essential tasks but very time-consuming as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In your busy life, how do you ensure you get everything done every day?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you ensure that you attend your Office every day and yet your household chores are well taken care of?</h4>



<p>Would it not relieve you significantly if there were extra helping hands to help you with all such tasks?</p>



<p>It sounds interesting on the face of it, although finding such Helping Hands in a city like Gurugram has always been a challenge.</p>



<p>Asking the nearest friend and neighbours could only get you a few options in a few days or weeks.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring a Full time Maid in Gurugram locally through referrals or maid agencies? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">HNM</a> today.</h4>



<p>Hiring Full time Maid in Gurugram locally through referrals or maid agencies is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges. </p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring full time maids locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Full time Maids to choose from. </p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek. </p>



<p>Whether you need a full time maid, full day maid, part time maid, cook, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: If available near your location, you will always find enough options for workers at HNM. </p>



<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire full time maids locally, there&#8217;s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the full time maid, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references. </p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a full time maid with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about worker&#8217;s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire full time maids locally or through a maid agency</h4>



<p>When you hire a full time maid in Gurugram locally or through maid agencies, without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any full time maid. </p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every worker.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire full time maids locally, ratings and reviews to assess worker&#8217;s suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a full time maid locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker. </p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the worker you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every worker at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on important factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc. </p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a worker&#8217;s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which eventually will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring full time maids locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a full time maid locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient for you.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of maid agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a full time maid in Gurugram. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>&#8220;<em>I need a good and reliable Babysitter, but don&#8217;t know where to find one</em>.&#8221; </p>



<p>It is one of the most common situations that many of us go through. </p>



<p>And at this stage, there&#8217;s not much choice that one can find around us.</p>



<p>Some obvious traditional options are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ask the neighbours, friends or family living in the city</li>



<li>Check with your current maid/cook if they know someone</li>



<li>Leave a note with your friend&#8217;s maid.</li>



<li>Or reach out to an agent/maid agency and try our luck.</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Babysitter cost in Delhi in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Babysitter in Delhi?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Babysitter in Delhi in 2024 varies between ₹13,000 and ₹20,000, depending on the profile of the Babysitter/Nanny you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. </p>



<p>For a Babysitter engaged from morning until evening (about 10/12 hrs of work), hiring the Babysitter or Nanny costs between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p>And if she&#8217;s a Live-in Babysitter/Nanny (24 hrs), the cost of hiring the Live-in Babysitter varies between ₹17,000 to ₹20,000. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>It is an entirely different story if you rely on the agents/maid agencies. Many of them turn into a foul experience. </p>



<p>Alternatively, you wait for the rest of the options until someone appears on your doorstep.</p>



<p>It is even more challenging if you want a live-in Babysitter.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you are a working mother, finding a competent and trustworthy babysitter for your baby can become one of the toughest jobs. </p>



<p>As a mother, you want someone good at her work and who can be trusted with the responsibility of the entire house when you are not around. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">No matter the situation, the babysitter must come through a source you can trust. </h4>



<p>The question always is how to find such a trustworthy source. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Babysitter-1.jpg" alt="babysitter" class="wp-image-84" /></figure>



<p>Meet Siso, a girl from Jharkhand who came to Delhi in 2015.</p>



<p>She needed a job that could fetch her some money.</p>



<p>Siso wanted to take care of herself and send a few savings to her parents in her village.</p>



<p>She was not a Babysitter by choice. She has always wanted to be a sports athlete and represent her college at the state level.&nbsp;Finally, she wanted to join forces or the police as a career.</p>



<p>But her financial situation at home brought her to Delhi. She had to give up on her career to earn her living &amp; support her parents back home in the village.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Siso came across our representative and registered herself at <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong>.</p>



<p>She did not pay anyone anything to be a part of <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong>. She joined the platform willingly and free of cost.</p>



<p>After a few weeks of joining Helpers Near Me, she got connected to a family in South Delhi, met with them, and finally decided to work there. Currently, she still works with the same family as a Babysitter.</p>



<p>The family was accommodating enough to ensure she studied whenever she had time.</p>



<p>Now, Siso earns her living, sends money to her parents, and prepares for her dream career.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">But<strong> come to think of it:</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Is this the reality for many other Maids, Babysitters or other Workers?</li>



<li>How many babysitters do we know who have a decent family to live with, get some decent money, and are allowed to pursue their careers simultaneously?</li>



<li>Do they all work without the pressure of an Agent and Contractor?</li>



<li>How many get to take their full salary home and not share it with any agents in between?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/verification-for-maids-is-easy-now-its-online/">Verification for Maids is easy in 2024. You can do it online. </a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to find an answer to &#8220;reliable Babysitter near me&#8221;?</p>



<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>



<p>Try remembering the last time you were trying to look for a Babysitter near you. It is always just so time-consuming. </p>



<p><strong>FIRST</strong>, you had to ask your neighbours if they knew someone.</p>



<p><strong>SECOND</strong>, you had to ask their Maids if they knew anyone looking for work as a Babysitter.</p>



<p><strong>THIRD</strong>, you had to leave your requirement with the nearest security guard you had come across.</p>



<p>And <strong>FOURTH</strong>, despite all this, you had to wait a minimum of a few days until someone showed up on your doorstep.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Babysitter charge every month near my location in 2024? What is the right salary or cost for hiring a Babysitter near me in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Babysitter in 2024 varies between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000. </p>



<p>They usually prefer coming in the morning and leaving in the evening.</p>



<p>However, if you are looking for a Live-in Babysitter, they usually charge monthly salaries in the range of ₹17,000 to ₹18,000.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you are looking for Babysitters who are a little better profile (Like the ones who work for the Expats in India), they usually end up charging around ₹20,000 to ₹23,000.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>By then, your need for a Babysitter had become so urgent that you hired the first or the second one who knocked on your door.</p>



<p>As soon as your problem of finding a reliable Babysitter was resolved, you did not bother too much about getting the background verification done for the person you hired.</p>



<p>After a few days, you were sort of okay with her work. And that was enough for you to move on with your life.</p>



<p>Until one day, when she left again, the whole process was repeated&nbsp;for the next Babysitter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Finding a Babysitter&#8221; is always taxing and, more so, very time-consuming.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Meet <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a></span>.</h4>



<p>From now on, you will not have to go through such a detailed process to find a reliable Babysitter near you.</p>



<p>Just follow these 5 really easy steps, and you should be able to find multiple Babysitters near you within a few minutes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">1st Step</span>: Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>, follow the &#8216;Find Now&#8217; button and log in with your credentials</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">2nd Step</span>: Enter the profile as &#8216;Babysitter&#8217; and Confirm your search location</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">3rd Step</span>: View profiles of multiple available Babysitters near you, with their ratings, background checks, distance, etc.</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline">5th Step</span>: Speak with all of them, meet with whoever you want and hire anyone you like from the list</h4>



<p>Once you have hired someone, pay the monthly salary directly to the Babysitter.</p>



<p>Now, compare this with all the hassle you had to go through when you were looking for a Babysitter earlier &#8211; a lot of references here &amp; there, a long wait, and in the end, only 1-2 people knocked on the door, etc.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring a Babysitter near you locally through referrals or maid agencies? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try&nbsp;<a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">HNM</a>&nbsp;today.</h4>



<p>Hiring Babysitters near you, locally through referrals or maid agencies, is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges.</p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring Babysitters locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Babysitters.</p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek.</p>



<p>Whether you need a maid, full time maid, full day maid, part time maid, cook, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: You will always find enough options for Babysitters at HNM if available near your location.</p>



<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire Babysitters locally, there’s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the Babysitter, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references.</p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a Babysitter with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about Babysitter’s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire Babysitters locally or through a maid agency</h4>



<p>When you hire a Babysitter near you, locally or through maid agencies, without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any Babysitter.</p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every Babysitter.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire Babysitters locally, ratings and reviews to assess workers’ suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a Babysitter locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker.</p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the Babysitter you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every Babysitter at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on essential factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc.</p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a babysitter’s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which will eventually help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring Babysitters locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a Babysitter locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming and inconvenient.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of maid agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a Babysitter near you.</p>



<p>You can connect with ample nearby Babysitters, compare the available choices, and contact them at your convenience, eliminating the need for physical visits with everyone or reliance on maid agencies.</p>

<p>And with HNM, you can do all of this in the comfort of your home by just using your smartphone.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/verification-for-maids-is-easy-now-its-online/">Verification for Maids &amp; Drivers is easy now in 2024.</a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The cities of India have unbelievably transformed themselves.</p>



<p>This&nbsp;change in cities significantly impacts the lives of people living in them.</p>



<p>Living in a city today is more complicated than about 10 years ago.</p>



<p>The regular working hours per day, around 7 hours earlier,&nbsp;have now expanded to 9-10 hours a day.</p>



<p>The population density is also high because many people are coming into cities to settle down.</p>



<p>Enough crowd &amp; traffic on the road has invariably increased the commuting time to and from the place of work.</p>



<p>People spend extended hours in their offices, and as a result, the time a person spends on themselves &amp; family has been reduced by a great deal.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Full time Maid cost in Noida in 2024? What is the right salary per month or charge for hiring a Full time Maid in Noida in 2024?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Full time Maid in Noida in 2024 varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. </p>



<p>Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier. </p>



<p>Likewise, Full Day Maids (also referred to as Full time Maids by many of us), who work for about 10-12 hrs, charge between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the Full time Maid cost in Noida in 2024? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>As expected, this change limits how much time one spends with self, family, friends &amp; relatives.</p>



<p>On top of this, hundreds of household tasks take countless amounts of time.</p>



<p>And especially if you are the lady of the house, you ensure many things almost daily.</p>



<p>Like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Getting a regular house cleaning done,</li>



<li>Ensuring everyone&#8217;s clothes are cleaned and ironed,</li>



<li>Making sure the food gets prepared on time and with enough care,</li>



<li>Taking out some extra time for random household needs,</li>



<li>Full day-long preparation for a party at home in the evening,</li>



<li>Ensuring the elders in the family are attended to, as required,</li>
</ul>



<p>And much more of such everyday needs.</p>



<p>These are all critical&nbsp;&amp; essential tasks but very time-consuming as well.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you ensure you get everything done in your busy life every day?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How do you ensure that you attend your Office every day and yet your household chores are well taken care of?</h4>



<p>Would it not relieve you significantly if there were extra helping hands to help you with all such tasks?</p>



<p>It sounds interesting on the face of it, although finding such Helping Hands in a city like Noida has always been a challenge.</p>



<p>Asking the nearest friend and neighbours could only get you a few options in a few days or weeks.</p>

<p>Hiring Full time Maid in Noida locally through referrals or maid agencies is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges. </p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring full time maids locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Full time Maids to choose from. </p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek. </p>



<p>Whether you need a full time maid, full day maid, part time maid, cook, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with the specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>

<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire full time maids locally, there&#8217;s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the full time maid, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references. </p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a full time maid with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about worker&#8217;s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire full time maids locally or through a maid agency</h4>



<p>When you hire a full time maid in Noida locally or through maid agencies, without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or maid agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any full time maid. </p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every worker.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire full time maids locally, ratings and reviews to assess worker&#8217;s suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a full time maid locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker. </p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the worker you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every worker at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on important factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc. </p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a worker&#8217;s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which eventually will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring full time maids locally or through maid agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a full time maid locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient for you.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of maid agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a full time maid in Noida. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>After trying all the options of finding a Maid or a Babysitter, there&#8217;s one last solution that most of us living in Metro cities try &#8211; reaching out to a Maid Agency!</p>



<p>And since the need to have a Maid at that stage is always urgent, we usually go ahead with the option that opens up in front of us.</p>



<p>So, what do you do when contacting a Maid Agency?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you search for a &#8216;Maid Agency near me&#8217; online.</li>



<li>Or you can find contacts of 1-2 Maid Agencies through your references</li>



<li>Next, you call them and let them know&nbsp;your requirement</li>



<li>You ask a few fundamental questions on whether you can rely on them.</li>



<li>And most importantly, you check how long it would take them to help you hire a Maid.</li>
</ul>



<p>The challenge of finding <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/how-to-find-a-reliable-maid-online/">a reliable Maid</a> is tough in bigger cities.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Maid cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Maid in any metro city of India in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Maid varies between ₹3,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the profile of the maid you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. For a <strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours</strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>



<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between ₹5,000 to ₹6,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to cook at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid ranges between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier. </p>

<p>And therefore, we don’t dwell much into the details of the Maid Agency as long as the problem gets solved for us, in any manner it may be.</p>



<p>Historically, Maid Agencies have existed for years in the cities.</p>



<p>Even though it costs a few thousand extras, some are good, offer great service, and are recognized by close references.</p>



<p>However, many maid agencies in almost every city in India are not operating legitimately.</p>



<p>No wonder why we keep hearing stories like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>The maid ran away with valuables.</em></li>



<li><em>The placement agency takes money, but the Maid flees</em></li>



<li><em>A maid service agency duped a doctor in Delhi</em></li>



<li><em>Citizens’ Experiences with Fake Agencies</em></li>
</ul>



<p>There are many such stories that we keep hearing from different parts of the city at different points in time.</p>



<p>These stories have become fairly common now.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you have gone past the stage of finding a maid through a maid agency, there are many further challenges you have to deal with.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">5 common challenges that most of us face with the Maid Agency</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>An element of doubt on their credibility &amp; reliability:</strong>&nbsp;Some common questions that occur to your mind are &#8211; How credible is the Maid Agency that you are dealing with? Will the Maid Agency ensure you get a reliable Maid? Can the Agent guarantee a safe recruit? Is it possible that the Maid Agency shares the past credentials of the Maid you hire? Would the Agency be there to help you if you face any problems?</li>



<li><strong>A full transparency issue</strong>: Will the Maid Agency be entirely transparent in its procedures? Will they share all the details of the Maid in absolute transparency?</li>



<li><strong>Question on how they treat the Maids?</strong> Does the Maid Agency treat their Maids with respect? How are they connected with the Maids? Are the Maids working with the agency willingly, or have they been forced to do the job of a Maid out of some liability or any hidden reason? Are the Maids being treated as Working Professionals?</li>



<li><strong>Uncertain financial transactions:</strong> Will the maid agency give the maid the right monthly salary? Would they provide the total amount that you give them, or would they charge a hefty commission from&nbsp;her&nbsp;every month’s salary? We often hear stories where the agencies charge exorbitant amounts of money from the customers but pay the maids in peanuts.</li>



<li><strong>And finally, are the Maids reliable enough?</strong> It is very natural to be concerned about the Maid’s reliability. Since the Maid will be with your family, children &amp; elders for an extended period and will have access to the entire house, the new person must be reliable enough, and we know her background in as much detail as possible.</li>
</ol>



<p>These challenges are always there, many before hiring a Maid and a few after.</p>



<p>Some doubts get answered; for the rest, most of us take a bit of risk and move on.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you find a Maid if you are not getting one easily?</h4>

<p>Hiring maids locally in Delhi NCR through referrals or maid agencies is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges.</p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring Maids locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Maids.</p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire Maids locally, there’s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through maid agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the Maid, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references.</p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a Maid with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about Maid’s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire Maids locally or through a maid agency</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire Maids locally, ratings and reviews to assess workers’ suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a Maid locally through referrals or a maid agency, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker.</p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the maid you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every Maid at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on essential factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc.</p>

<p>Hiring a Maid locally through referrals or a maid agency will always be costly, time-consuming and inconvenient.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/verification-for-maids-is-easy-now-its-online/">Verification for Maids is easy in 2024. You can do it online. </a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Have you ever wondered how difficult it is to find an answer to &#8220;part time maids near me&#8221;?</p>



<p>It seems even tougher when you need one urgently.</p>



<p>Remember the last time you were trying to look for a part time maid? What did you have to go through?</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>, you had to ask your neighbours if they knew someone.</p>



<p><strong>Second</strong>, you had to ask their maids if they knew any other part time maids looking for work.</p>



<p><strong>Third</strong>, you had to leave your requirements with the nearest security guard you had come across.</p>



<p>And <strong>fourth</strong>, despite all this, you had to wait a few days till someone showed up on your doorstep.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Part time Maid cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Part time Maid in any metro city of India in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Part time Maid in 2024 varies between ₹5,000 and ₹6,000.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. For a <strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours</strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/how-to-find-good-cooks-near-me/">cook </a>at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid range between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>By then, your need for a Part time Maid had become so urgent that you hired the first or second one who knocked on your door.</p>



<p>When your problem of &#8220;finding part time maids near me&#8221; was resolved, you did not bother about getting the background verification done for the part time maid you hired.</p>



<p>After a few days, you were sort of okay with her work. And that was enough for you to move on with your life.</p>



<p>When she left again one day, the whole process was repeated&nbsp;for the next part time Maid.</p>



<p>Come to think about it, this &#8220;finding a part time maid near me&#8221; process is always taxing and, more so, very time-consuming.</p>

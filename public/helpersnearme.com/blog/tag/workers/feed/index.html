<p>Helper App! All your doubts about a Helper App are genuine. </p>



<p>And yet there is a Helper App that helps you connect with 100+ different profiles of blue-collar workers from nearby &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a>.</p>



<p>Thus far, finding workers through an App would have been beyond one&#8217;s imagination, but here it is. </p>



<p>So you can find them and many more at Helpers Near Me, whether you are looking for Domestic Workers, School Workers, Restaurant Workers, Factory Workers, or Construction Workers.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Helper cost? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Helper?</h4>



<p>The average monthly cost of hiring a Helper is around ₹12,000 to ₹13,000, depending on the Helper profile you are looking for.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the cost of Helpers near you? Try <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/salary-tracker">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Helpers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>In India, when you are looking for Workers for your home or your workplace or your business, here is the usual process that most of us follow:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>We would first reach out to our close references &#8211; friends, neighbours, colleagues, and whoever else lives close to our home or your workplace </li>



<li>We would then reach out to current workers working at our place and ask them if they are someone who would be interested in the work we have at hand.</li>



<li>And at times when the need is urgent, we even reach out to the agencies and contractors who work as placement agents. </li>
</ol>



<p>Whichever process we follow, in the end, it is either or some of the following:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Long wait</strong> till we end up finding someone</li>



<li><strong>Enough efforts</strong> in reaching out to the close or distant links</li>



<li><strong>Reliance</strong> on individual references and word of mouth</li>



<li><strong>Pay a huge amount of commission</strong> to the agents/contractors, or</li>



<li>Live with the <strong>issue of managing things somehow till you find someone</strong> </li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it: This whole process of finding a worker is always taxing and time-consuming.</h4>

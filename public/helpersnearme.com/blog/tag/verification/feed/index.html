<h4 class="wp-block-heading">To hire a Driver is one thing. And to verify his background is the other.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How often do you do both?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">Background Verification services of Helpers Near Me</a> and verify your Driver today.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>. From time to time, HNM also engages with Government bodies and NGOs to spread the platform&#8217;s accessibility to as many workers all over India as possible.<strong> </strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Did you hire a Driver in Delhi NCR? Did you verify his credentials?</p>



<p>Research indicates that less than 20% of people get the credentials verified of their Drivers and other Workers who work at their homes or workplaces.</p>



<p>The study also indicates that about 95% of people who work as Workers are a genuine bunch of people trying to earn a respectful living.</p>



<p>But to find the balance of 5%, who stains the entire Workers Community, one has to get every individual verified.</p>



<p>Whether a new Employee in an MNC, a new Tenant or when you hire a Driver or any other Worker, verifying the credentials is a norm, which only about 20% of us follow.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, where do you belong when you hire a driver &#8211; 80% who never get their Drivers&#8217; credentials verified or the rest?</h4>



<p>Even though our Government is making every effort to ask every one of us to &#8220;verify before you hire a driver or any other worker&#8221;, most of us often ignore it.</p>



<p>We just keep a copy of their IDs, and that&#8217;s it.</p>



<p>Sometimes, we take the pains of going to the nearest police station for verification. But the actual percentage of us taking this extra pain is less.</p>



<p>A major portion of the people who hire Drivers, Maids or any other Helpers ignores the whole &#8220;background verification&#8221; process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Well, if you are willing to take that extra mile, here&#8217;s a new initiative that makes verifying the credentials very simple when you hire a Driver, Maid or any other Helper who works at your place or office.</h4>



<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">new initiative</a> from <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/">Helpers Near Me</a><strong>. </strong></p>



<p>It is an <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">online Background Verification Service</a></strong></span>.</p>



<p>This service lets you verify your Maid, Driver or any other Helper online and in the most convenient way possible.</p>



<p>Imagine getting a detailed Background Verification Report of your Maid or Driver working at your home.</p>



<p>Here are 3 quick steps you need to take when you need your Maid&#8217;s Background Verification Report.</p>



<p>And all of it can be done directly through our mobile phones.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 1:</strong></h4>



<p>Visit the <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">Background Verification page</a> of <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 2:</strong></h4>



<p>Fill in your Driver&#8217;s necessary details if you have them (Name, Phone, ID number &amp; Address, if you have).</p>



<p>Or you can choose to fill in your details only (again, just your Name, Phone &amp; Email)</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 3:</strong></h4>



<p>Make a secure payment through your Paytm Account or Credit/Debit Card.</p>



<p>That is all. You must follow the above-mentioned basic steps to initiate your Verification request.</p>



<p>Post your request, and the <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong> team will contact you for any further details if required.</p>



<p>Or, if all the details are intact, you may get your Driver&#8217;s Background Verification Report in 10-15 working days maximum.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t even need to go anywhere to pick up the report.</p>



<p>So when you hire a driver, you get his detailed Background Verification report directly in your email inbox.</p>



<p>Helpers Near Me follows a <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">2/3 step verification</a> process.</p>



<p><strong>1) ID Check</strong>, which confirms the validity of the govt. ID the person carries </p>



<p><strong>2) Court/Criminal Records Check</strong>, which scans the Court Records of the individual at the neighbouring Indian District Courts around his/her address, &amp; </p>



<p><strong>3) Address Check</strong>, which reports whether the person stays at the place where one claims to be staying.</p>



<p>Our associate company&#8217;s integration with UIDAI, NSDL, and reliable Government District portals ensures a diligent Background Verification of every individual&#8217;s credential that goes through the process.</p>



<p>With this kind of Professional Background Verification Check, you get transparency into Driver’s Identity, Antecedents, and Character.</p>



<p>This kind of Professional Verification Check allows you to take an informed decision on the person you have already hired or are about to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">To conclude, when you hire a Driver, with this <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">new Background Verification initiative of Helpers Near Me</a>, you have an option to be<strong> 100% sure of his credentials</strong>.</h4>



<p>If you are still relying on your Driver&#8217;s ID copy and some references, we suggest you verify your Driver, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/best-option-to-find-a-reliable-maid-in-gurugram/">Maid</a></span>, <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/how-to-find-a-reliable-babysitter-in-noida/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Nanny</span></a>, or other <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/verification-of-restaurant-staff-is-easy-fast-now-it-is-online/">Helpers</a> today!</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Verification&nbsp;for Maids, Drivers, Cooks or other Domestic Workers is always a task.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">But it is easy now in 2024.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try the <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">Professional Verification Services of Helpers Near Me</a> today.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Verify your workers legally and save yourself from all the hassle.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Now you can <strong><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">legally verify your Workers/Staff at Helpers Near Me</a></strong>. We follow a 2/3 Step Background Verification Process. <strong>OPTIONS </strong>&#8211; 1) ID Check, which confirms the validity of the govt. ID the individual carries, 2) Court/Criminal Records Check, which scans the court records of the individual at the neighbouring Indian District Courts around his/her present or permanent address, &amp; 3) Address Check, which reports whether the individual stays at the place where one claims to be staying. At HNM, <strong>YOU CAN VERIFY</strong> your Domestic Workers, School Workers, Restaurant Workers, Office Workers, Factory Workers, Hospital Workers, Store Workers and Logistics Workers like Truck Drivers, Loaders, etc.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/background-verification-drivers/">Verification for Drivers is simple in 2024</a>.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Accomplishing Background Verification for Maids, Cooks, Drivers, or any other Domestic Worker working at your home is as challenging as finding them near you.</p>



<p>The usual offline choices are always available.</p>



<p>However, they seem quite cumbersome when you get into accomplishing them.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you must get a hard copy of the Police Verification Form / Background Verification Form from the local police station. At times, you can also find it at your society&#8217;s admin office. In some cities, you also get the verification form online. However, the rest of the steps are still offline.</li>



<li>Second, you fill out the form for the Maid with her full details.</li>



<li>Then you go and physically submit it to the nearest police station (or ask her to do so)</li>



<li>Sometimes, you must be present with the Maid at the police station.</li>



<li>You may also have to revisit the place if the documents remain pending.</li>



<li>In the end, after a few days, you pick up the approved &amp; stamped copy of the Police Verification form of your Maid.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In our busy lifestyle, this exercise becomes so much of a task that we often never get into it. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">We end up avoiding the verification for maids until we can or unless we are asked to get it done.</h4>



<p>And it is the same for many of us.</p>



<p>Less than 10% of us get proper due diligence done for the Maids or Drivers who are hired at homes.</p>



<p>The rest of us take a copy of the Maid&#8217;s / Driver&#8217;s ID and rely mostly on their references.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How sure are you of your Maid&#8217;s and Driver&#8217;s past if you rely on the ID copy?</li>



<li>Would the reference who got you the Maid or the Driver take her/his guarantee?</li>



<li>Can an ID copy ensure a safe environment for your family?</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In reality, nobody takes anyone&#8217;s guarantee. And that&#8217;s a fact.</h4>



<p>People may still give references for Maids or Drivers, but the real assurance would come only after you&#8217;ve professionally verified the person&#8217;s credentials.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">9 reasons why it is essential to perform background checks/police verification for Maids, Cooks, Drivers, Babysitters or other Domestic Workers before hiring them:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Safety of your Home and Family</h4>



<p>Domestic workers have direct access to your home, belongings, and family members. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who do not have a history of criminal behaviour, violence, or other activities that could threaten your household&#8217;s safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ensuring the safety of Children and Elderly at home</h4>



<p>If you are hiring a Maid, Babysitter, Driver or Elderly Care attendant to provide care for children, the elderly at home, or individuals with special needs, a background check is crucial. </p>



<p>It helps verify their suitability for the task you are hiring them for.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prevention of Theft and Fraud&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Background checks can help identify workers with a history of theft, fraud, or other dishonest behaviour. </p>



<p>This safeguards your personal belongings, valuables, and financial assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Trust and Peace of Mind</h4>



<p>Knowing that your Maid, Cook, Driver, Babysitter or other domestic worker has undergone a thorough background check can give you peace of mind, allowing you to trust them more easily with your home and family responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Protection of your Privacy</h4>



<p>Domestic Workers often have access to sensitive and private information within your household. </p>



<p>A professional background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who can be trusted to maintain confidentiality and respect your privacy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Personal Reputation</h4>



<p>The behaviour and conduct of your domestic worker can reflect on your family&#8217;s reputation. </p>



<p>Hiring individuals with a positive background can help maintain your family&#8217;s standing in the community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Legal Compliance</h4>



<p>As you may be aware, In India, there are legal recommendations regarding background checks for domestic workers, especially if they work with vulnerable family members such as children or the elderly. </p>



<p>And if you are staying in a gated community, your building admin would have similar compliances. </p>



<p>Conducting background checks ensures that you comply with applicable rules and regulations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Minimizing Liability</h4>



<p>Within your society, you could be liable if your Maid, Driver or other Domestic Worker engages in harmful or illegal activities while under your employ. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps mitigate this risk by demonstrating due diligence in your hiring process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Long-Term Relationship</h4>



<p>If you are considering hiring a Maid, Cook, Babysitter or Driver for a long-term engagement, a professional background check ensures that you are making a sound investment of time &amp; effort in someone who will contribute positively to your household over time.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It would be an injustice to assume that the background of every Maid, Cook, Babysitter or Driver is stained. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">An estimated 80-90% of Maids, Drivers, Cooks and other Domestic Workers are genuine people trying to earn a respectful life.</h4>



<p>Helpers Near Me connects with hundreds and thousands of such workers daily.</p>



<p>We can confidently say that a considerable percentage of workers are genuine. They all want to work diligently and earn a respectful living.</p>



<p>However, some want to make some quick money or have hidden motives. Usually, this small set of workers stains the entire Maids, Drivers, and other workers&#8217; community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Getting a proper Police Verification or a Professional Background Verification for Maids ensures the family is protected &amp; secured in all possible ways.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Here&#8217;s an initiative from Helpers Near Me that will help you with <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">professional background verification</a> for maids, drivers, cooks, babysitters, or other domestic workers<strong>. </strong></h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">For every worker, Helpers Near Me follows a stringent <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/verifications">2/3-Step Verification Process</a>:</h4>



<p>1)&nbsp;<strong>ID Verification </strong>&#8211; At a basic level, the ID of your Maid is verified through genuine Government sources</p>



<p>2)<strong> Criminal/Court Records Checks </strong>&#8211; In this case, we scan the Criminal/Court Records of the Maid. This check is done through a reliable Government District portal that details Criminal/Court Cases of individuals, if there are any.</p>



<p>3) On a special request, at a little additional cost, Helpers Near Me also does a <strong>Physical Address Verification</strong> of the individual, which is the <strong>3rd Step</strong>. In this case, a verifier visits the place and verifies the individual&#8217;s address.</p>



<p>Our associate company&#8217;s integration with UIDAI, NSDL, and reliable Government District portals ensures a diligent Background Verification of every individual&#8217;s credential that goes through the process.</p>

<p>This kind of Professional Verification check allows you to make an informed decision on the person you have already hired or are about to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Such professional verification for Maids ensures a safe environment for your family at home.</h4>



<p>If you still rely on a copy of your Maid&#8217;s ID and some references, we suggest you verify your <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/5-easy-steps-to-find-a-maid-in-delhi-ncr/">Maid</a></span>, Driver, <a href="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/how-to-find-reliable-babysitter-near-me/"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Nanny</span></a>, or other workers today!</p>

<p>Looking for online police verification or professional background checks for drivers?</p>



<p>Getting background verification checks done for drivers, maids, cooks, or other workers at your place is as challenging as finding them.</p>



<p>Even though the usual offline choice is available, we all typically look for an online option &#8211; an online police verification option or any other professional background check option.</p>



<p>When you get into the available offline option, you often find it quite cumbersome:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you must get a Police Verification Form from the local police station or your society&#8217;s office. In some cities, you can also access an online police verification form. However, the rest of the steps are still offline.</li>



<li>Second, you fill out the form for the Driver with his full detail</li>



<li>Then you go and submit it to the nearest police station, either yourself or ask the Driver to do so</li>



<li>Sometimes, you even have to be physically present with the Driver at the police station.</li>



<li>And if the relevant documents are pending, you may end up visiting there twice</li>



<li>In the end, after a few days, you get the approved &amp; stamped copy of the Police Verification Form for your Driver</li>
</ol>



<p>In our busy lifestyle, this exercise becomes so much of a task that we often never get into it.</p>



<p>Most of us end up avoiding it until we can.</p>



<p>The fact is that only about 10% of us go through the whole exercise of due diligence before we hire the Driver, Maid, or other workers at our place.</p>



<p>And the rest of us take a copy of the individual&#8217;s ID and rely mostly on their reference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>But does an ID copy give you assurance about your Driver&#8217;s past credentials?</li>



<li>Would the reference who got you the Driver or the Maid take his/her guarantee?</li>



<li>Would an ID copy ensure a safe environment for your family at home or while travelling?</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The fact is that in today&#8217;s time, nobody takes anyone&#8217;s guarantee.</h4>



<p>No matter how strong a reference you get, the person would never take a guarantee of the Driver he&#8217;s referred.</p>



<p>People you know may still recommend a driver or a maid. But you can only be truly assured after legally verifying the person&#8217;s credentials.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">9 reasons why it is essential to perform background checks/police verification on Drivers, Maids, Cooks, Babysitters or other Domestic Workers before hiring them:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Safety of your Home and Family</h4>



<p>Your Driver and other domestic workers have direct access to your home, belongings, and family members. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who do not have a history of criminal behaviour, violence, or other activities that could threaten your household&#8217;s safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ensuring the safety of Children and Elderly at home</h4>



<p>If you are hiring a Driver, Maid, Babysitter or Elderly Care attendant to provide care for children, the elderly at home, or individuals with special needs, a background check is crucial. </p>



<p>It helps verify their suitability for the task you are hiring them for.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prevention of Theft and Fraud&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Background checks can help identify workers with a history of theft, fraud, or other dishonest behaviour. </p>



<p>This safeguards your personal belongings, valuables, and financial assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Trust and Peace of Mind</h4>



<p>Knowing that your Driver, Maid, Cook, Babysitter or other domestic worker has undergone a thorough background check can give you peace of mind, allowing you to trust them more easily with your home and family responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Protection of your Privacy</h4>



<p>Your Driver and Domestic Workers often have access to sensitive and private information within your household. </p>



<p>A professional background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who can be trusted to maintain confidentiality and respect your privacy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Personal Reputation</h4>



<p>The behaviour and conduct of your Driver and Domestic Worker can reflect on your family&#8217;s reputation. </p>



<p>Hiring individuals with a positive background can help maintain your family&#8217;s standing in the community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Legal Compliance</h4>



<p>As you may be aware, In India, there are legal recommendations regarding background checks for domestic workers, especially if they work with vulnerable family members such as children or the elderly. </p>



<p>And if you are staying in a gated community, your building admin would have similar compliances. </p>



<p>Conducting background checks ensures that you comply with applicable rules and regulations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Minimizing Liability</h4>



<p>Within your society, you could be liable if your Driver, Maid or other Domestic Worker engages in harmful or illegal activities while under your employ. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps mitigate this risk by demonstrating due diligence in your hiring process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Long-Term Relationship</h4>



<p>If you are considering hiring a Driver, Maid, Cook or Babysitter for a long-term engagement, a professional background check ensures that you are making a sound investment of time &amp; effort in someone who will contribute positively to your household over time.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It would be incorrect to say that every Driver&#8217;s background is stained.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More than 80%-90% of Drivers, Maids, Cooks and other blue-collar workers are genuine people trying to earn a respectful life.</h4>



<p><strong>Helpers Near Me</strong> connects with many such Drivers, Maids, and other Helpers almost daily.</p>



<p>Largely, a considerable percentage of Domestic &amp; Workplace Helpers are genuine.</p>



<p>They all want to work diligently and earn a respectful living.</p>



<p>However, some want to make some quick money or have hidden motives.</p>



<p>And usually, this small set of people stains the entire workers&#8217; community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Getting a proper Police Verification or a Professional Background Verification done for the individual ensures a safe environment for the family.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p>Accomplishing Background Verification of domestic help like Maids, Cooks, Drivers, Babysitters, Gardeners, and others is as challenging as finding them near you.</p>



<p>The usual offline choices are always available.</p>



<p>However, they seem quite cumbersome when you get into accomplishing them.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you must get a hard copy of the Police Verification Form / Background Verification Form from the local police station. At times, you can also find it at your society&#8217;s admin office.

<li>In the end, after a few days, you pick up the approved &amp; stamped copy of the Police Verification form of your domestic help.</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In our busy lifestyle, this exercise becomes so much of a task that we often never get into it.</h4>



<p>We end up avoiding the verification for maids and other necessary checks until we can.</p>



<p>And it is the same for many of us.</p>



<p>The fact is that before hiring domestic help at our place, only about less than 10% of us go through the whole exercise of getting proper due diligence done.</p>



<p>The rest of us just take a copy of the Maid or Driver&#8217;s ID and rely on their reference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it: How sure are you of your Maid&#8217;s and Driver&#8217;s past if you just rely on the ID copy?</h4>



<p>Would the reference who got you the Maid or the Driver take her/his guarantee?</p>



<p>Can an ID copy ensure a safe environment for your family?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In reality, nobody takes anyone&#8217;s guarantee. And that&#8217;s a fact.</h4>



<p>People may still give you references for Maids or Drivers, but the real assurance would come only after you&#8217;ve professionally verified the person&#8217;s credentials.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Wondering where to find a good permanent Car Driver for yourself?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s the best app for Drivers in 2024 &#8211; <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a>.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">This app for drivers helps you find multiple Private Drivers near you in just a few minutes. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you seek one, HNM also gives you access to the Driver&#8217;s background verification report. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And this is all online! Try it today.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>. From time to time, HNM also engages with Government bodies and NGOs to spread the platform&#8217;s accessibility to as many workers all over India as possible.<strong> </strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="../background-verification-drivers/index.html">Verification for Drivers is easy in 2024. You can do it online.</a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>App for Drivers!</p>



<p>For most of us living in Metro cities, having a Private Driver sometimes seems necessary.</p>



<p>Some days, even if you have to travel only a few kilometres, the roads are always so jam-packed that even a half-hour drive takes a minimum of an hour and a half.</p>



<p>Especially in the peak morning and evening, managing a bumper-to-bumper drive takes away all your energy and keeps you away from some of the essential things you might have done if you had a driver.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Driver cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Driver in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Driver in 2024 varies between ₹17,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the car to drive and whether it is for a private or commercial vehicle.</p>



<p>In some cases, the cost of a Driver goes as high as ₹22,000 to ₹25,000, especially if he&#8217;s driving an automatic luxury car or if he&#8217;s driving the car for an Expat.</p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="../../salary-tracker.html">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the cost of Drivers near your location in 2024? Try <strong><a href="../../salary-tracker.html">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It is quite a task when you must drive your car all day and by yourself.</h4>



<p>Here are some of the challenges that you face every day if you are driving yourself:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Where should you park your car</strong> when attending multiple meetings at different locations? A parking ticket is less of an issue. The concern always is finding a decent space.</li>



<li><strong>Driving through the crowded roads</strong>, more so at peak times, especially when crossing the city&#8217;s central hub.</li>



<li><strong>Managing bumper-to-bumper drive every day</strong>, morning &amp; evening.</li>



<li><strong>Safety of valuables like office laptops, mobile phones or shades</strong> when you park your car at some corner, where you had to, just because you were running short of time for the meeting</li>



<li><strong>A minimum of 1-2 hrs of drive time every day</strong>, no matter which city you live in</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just some of the multiple challenges that many of us face.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Having a permanent &amp; private driver solves most of the issues:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>No waiting time</strong> &#8211; You leave your car anywhere &amp; hop on it somewhere, all because now you have a Driver on call</li>



<li><strong>Finding a parking space</strong> is no longer a concern. You also save on the parking ticket!</li>



<li><strong>Driving through the crowded roads</strong> all through the day seems easy.</li>



<li>And the best part is that <strong>you get to either work, take essential calls or relax</strong> during those 1-2 hours of drive time.</li>
</ul>



<p>By having a private driver, all your challenges go away.</p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s still one big challenge.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to find a Private Driver? </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">There aren&#8217;t many options available when you need a permanent &amp; private Driver for yourself.</h4>



<p><strong>Your first thought</strong> is to ask your friend, neighbour, nearest security guard or people working at your place.</p>



<p>Sure, you can find a Driver by this approach. However, it would take at least a week or a few weeks to find one.</p>



<p>Your <strong>second approach</strong> is finding a Driver online or looking for an app for a driver. </p>



<p>You may find a few options here through your app for drivers.</p>



<p>But the usual options you may come across are those where you get a Driver for the day or a few hours, where you pay them hourly.</p>



<p>However, this option doesn&#8217;t work out all the time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you own a car, your need for a driver is not hourly, but for the one who can work for you permanently.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Meet <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a>.</h4>



<p>It is the best app for drivers looking for a private driver.</p>



<p>It solves the problem of finding &amp; hiring a Driver permanently as easily as possible.</p>



<p>The charges are nominal &#8211; starting at ₹99. </p>



<p>You get to connect with multiple drivers near you.</p>



<p>Being connected to multiple drivers ensures you get the best driver who is well-experienced, understands the city well, and fits your budget.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">11 unique reasons why you should try <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a> when you are searching for a driver through an app for drivers:</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Are you still hiring Drivers near you locally through referrals? Understand the drawbacks. Reconsider your options. Try <a href="../../index.html">HNM</a> today &#8211; the best app for Drivers.</h4>



<p>Hiring Drivers near you, locally through referrals, is a common practice, but it also comes with drawbacks and challenges.</p>



<p>Understand the potential drawbacks here and reconsider your options:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Hiring Drivers locally means you have limited choices &amp; flexibility</h4>



<p>Whether hiring locally or through referrals, you may have a limited pool of Drivers.</p>



<p>Your options are often restricted to the people you know or those available in your immediate vicinity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM offers flexibility regarding the type of domestic help you seek.</p>



<p>Whether you need a driver, cook, full-time maid, full-day maid, part-time maid, babysitter, or elderly caregiver, you can find domestic workers with specific skills and availability at Helpers Near Me.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: If available near your location, you will always find enough options for Drivers at HNM.</p>



<p>You will also have the flexibility of choosing from a list of 100+ profiles of workers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. When you hire Drivers locally, there’s always a lack of proper screening, transparency &amp; documentation</h4>



<p>When hiring through referrals, locally or through agencies, you may not have access to complete details about the Driver, relevant documents like Aadhar, Voter Card or Driving License (for Car Drivers), comprehensive background checks or references.</p>



<p>This can increase the risk of hiring a Driver with an inadequate work history or potentially questionable background.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM creates detailed profiles with information about Driver&#8217;s skills, experiences, and references. Before onboarding the workers, HNM also gathers relevant documents to help you in the hiring process.</p>



<p>This transparency can help you make informed decisions about who to hire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Security concerns are high when you hire Drivers locally</h4>



<p>When you hire a Driver near you locally without proper background checks and verifications, you may expose your home and family to potential security risks when hiring locally through referrals or agencies.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM follows a 2/3 step background verification process before onboarding any Driver.</p>



<p>This stringent verification process ensures proper screening of every Driver.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. When you hire Drivers locally, ratings and reviews to assess workers’ suitability at your place are always missing</h4>



<p>When you hire a Driver locally through referrals, you will never be able to have ratings and reviews of the worker.</p>



<p>You are always in the dark and hire based on assumptions if such important information is unavailable on the Driver you are about to hire or have already hired.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: For every Driver at Helpers Near Me, the platform includes ratings and reviews based on essential factors like feedback from previous employers (if available), distance to work, prior experience, vaccination status, background checks, etc.</p>



<p>Collectively, this feedback can give you insights into a driver&#8217;s suitability at your place, ethics, reliability, and performance, which will eventually help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hiring Drivers locally or through agencies means the entire experience will be either costly, inconvenient or time-consuming</h4>



<p>Hiring a Driver locally through referrals or an agency will always be costly, time-consuming and inconvenient.</p>



<p>You will pay huge commissions if you take the help of agencies. Additionally, there will always be enough coordination involved.</p>



<p>The entire experience will never be as convenient.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Benefits with Helpers Near Me</span>: HNM is the most convenient and cost-effective way of hiring a Driver near you.</p>



<p>You can connect with ample nearby Drivers, compare the available choices, and contact them at your convenience, eliminating the need for physical visits with everyone or reliance on agencies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, HNM will always be cost-effective as you will save on the commissions involved while using the middlemen to hire a Driver near you.</p>



<p>And with HNM, you can do all of this in the comfort of your home by just using your smartphone.</p>

<p>Looking for online police verification or professional background checks for drivers?</p>



<p>Getting background verification checks done for drivers, maids, cooks, or other workers at your place is as challenging as finding them.</p>



<p>Even though the usual offline choice is available, we all typically look for an online option &#8211; an online police verification option or any other professional background check option.</p>



<p>When you get into the available offline option, you often find it quite cumbersome:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you must get a Police Verification Form from the local police station or your society&#8217;s office. In some cities, you can also access an online police verification form. However, the rest of the steps are still offline.</li>



<li>Second, you fill out the form for the Driver with his full detail</li>



<li>Then you go and submit it to the nearest police station, either yourself or ask the Driver to do so</li>



<li>Sometimes, you even have to be physically present with the Driver at the police station.</li>



<li>And if the relevant documents are pending, you may end up visiting there twice</li>



<li>In the end, after a few days, you get the approved &amp; stamped copy of the Police Verification Form for your Driver</li>
</ol>



<p>In our busy lifestyle, this exercise becomes so much of a task that we often never get into it.</p>



<p>Most of us end up avoiding it until we can.</p>



<p>The fact is that only about 10% of us go through the whole exercise of due diligence before we hire the Driver, Maid, or other workers at our place.</p>



<p>And the rest of us take a copy of the individual&#8217;s ID and rely mostly on their reference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Think about it:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>But does an ID copy give you assurance about your Driver&#8217;s past credentials?</li>



<li>Would the reference who got you the Driver or the Maid take his/her guarantee?</li>



<li>Would an ID copy ensure a safe environment for your family at home or while travelling?</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The fact is that in today&#8217;s time, nobody takes anyone&#8217;s guarantee.</h4>



<p>No matter how strong a reference you get, the person would never take a guarantee of the Driver he&#8217;s referred.</p>



<p>People you know may still recommend a driver or a maid. But you can only be truly assured after legally verifying the person&#8217;s credentials.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">9 reasons why it is essential to perform background checks/police verification on Drivers, Maids, Cooks, Babysitters or other Domestic Workers before hiring them:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Safety of your Home and Family</h4>



<p>Your Driver and other domestic workers have direct access to your home, belongings, and family members. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who do not have a history of criminal behaviour, violence, or other activities that could threaten your household&#8217;s safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ensuring the safety of Children and Elderly at home</h4>



<p>If you are hiring a Driver, Maid, Babysitter or Elderly Care attendant to provide care for children, the elderly at home, or individuals with special needs, a background check is crucial. </p>



<p>It helps verify their suitability for the task you are hiring them for.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prevention of Theft and Fraud&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Background checks can help identify workers with a history of theft, fraud, or other dishonest behaviour. </p>



<p>This safeguards your personal belongings, valuables, and financial assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Trust and Peace of Mind</h4>



<p>Knowing that your Driver, Maid, Cook, Babysitter or other domestic worker has undergone a thorough background check can give you peace of mind, allowing you to trust them more easily with your home and family responsibilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Protection of your Privacy</h4>



<p>Your Driver and Domestic Workers often have access to sensitive and private information within your household. </p>



<p>A professional background check helps ensure that you are hiring individuals who can be trusted to maintain confidentiality and respect your privacy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Personal Reputation</h4>



<p>The behaviour and conduct of your Driver and Domestic Worker can reflect on your family&#8217;s reputation. </p>



<p>Hiring individuals with a positive background can help maintain your family&#8217;s standing in the community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Legal Compliance</h4>



<p>As you may be aware, In India, there are legal recommendations regarding background checks for domestic workers, especially if they work with vulnerable family members such as children or the elderly. </p>



<p>And if you are staying in a gated community, your building admin would have similar compliances. </p>



<p>Conducting background checks ensures that you comply with applicable rules and regulations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Minimizing Liability</h4>



<p>Within your society, you could be liable if your Driver, Maid or other Domestic Worker engages in harmful or illegal activities while under your employ. </p>



<p>Conducting a background check helps mitigate this risk by demonstrating due diligence in your hiring process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Long-Term Relationship</h4>



<p>If you are considering hiring a Driver, Maid, Cook or Babysitter for a long-term engagement, a professional background check ensures that you are making a sound investment of time &amp; effort in someone who will contribute positively to your household over time.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It would be incorrect to say that every Driver&#8217;s background is stained.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More than 80%-90% of Drivers, Maids, Cooks and other blue-collar workers are genuine people trying to earn a respectful life.</h4>



<p><strong>Helpers Near Me</strong> connects with many such Drivers, Maids, and other Helpers almost daily.</p>



<p>Largely, a considerable percentage of Domestic &amp; Workplace Helpers are genuine.</p>



<p>They all want to work diligently and earn a respectful living.</p>



<p>However, some want to make some quick money or have hidden motives.</p>



<p>And usually, this small set of people stains the entire workers&#8217; community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Getting a proper Police Verification or a Professional Background Verification done for the individual ensures a safe environment for the family.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

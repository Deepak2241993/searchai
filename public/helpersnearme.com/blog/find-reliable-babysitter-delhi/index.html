<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Finding a reliable Babysitter in Delhi NCR is easy in 2024. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It is no longer a challenging task.</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a> now and connect with several legally verified Babysitters near you in just a few minutes.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p class="has-black-color has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>HELPERS NEAR ME (HNM) helps you find &amp; hire legally verified workers near you</strong>. The platform uses technology and a lot of groundwork to help you connect directly with workers without any middlemen or commissions. On the other end, <strong>HNM helps the underprivileged workers of India find local employment, free of cost, directly from nearby employers like yourself</strong>.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="../verification-for-maids-is-easy-now-its-online/index.html">Verification for Maids is easy in 2024. You can do it online. </a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>&#8220;<em>I need a good and reliable Babysitter, but don&#8217;t know where to find one</em>.&#8221; </p>



<p>It is one of the most common situations that many of us go through. </p>



<p>And at this stage, there&#8217;s not much choice that one can find around us.</p>



<p>Some obvious traditional options are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ask the neighbours, friends or family living in the city</li>



<li>Check with your current maid/cook if they know someone</li>



<li>Leave a note with your friend&#8217;s maid.</li>



<li>Or reach out to an agent/maid agency and try our luck.</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Babysitter cost in Delhi in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Babysitter in Delhi?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Babysitter in Delhi in 2024 varies between ₹13,000 and ₹20,000, depending on the profile of the Babysitter/Nanny you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. </p>



<p>For a Babysitter engaged from morning until evening (about 10/12 hrs of work), hiring the Babysitter or Nanny costs between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p>And if she&#8217;s a Live-in Babysitter/Nanny (24 hrs), the cost of hiring the Live-in Babysitter varies between ₹17,000 to ₹20,000. </p>



<p><em>(SOURCE &#8211; <a href="../../salary-tracker.html">SalaryTracker</a>)</em> </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">Do you want to check the Babysitter cost in Delhi in 2024? Try <strong><a href="../../salary-tracker.html">SalaryTracker</a></strong>. It is a free salary tracking tool for 100+ profiles of Workers near you. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>It is an entirely different story if you rely on the agents/maid agencies. Many of them turn into a foul experience. </p>



<p>Alternatively, you wait for the rest of the options until someone appears on your doorstep.</p>



<p>It is even more challenging if you want a live-in Babysitter.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you are a working mother, finding a competent and trustworthy babysitter for your baby can become one of the toughest jobs. </p>



<p>As a mother, you want someone good at her work and who can be trusted with the responsibility of the entire house when you are not around. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">No matter the situation, the babysitter must come through a source you can trust. </h4>



<p>The question always is how to find such a trustworthy source. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Meet <a href="../../index.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Helpers Near Me</span></a>.</h4>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><noscript><img decoding="async" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Babysitter-1.jpg" alt="babysitter" class="wp-image-84" /></noscript><img decoding="async" src='data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E' data-src="https://helpersnearme.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Babysitter-1.jpg" alt="babysitter" class="lazyload wp-image-84" /></figure>



<p>Meet Siso, a girl from Jharkhand who came to Delhi in 2015.</p>



<p>She needed a job that could fetch her some money.</p>



<p>Siso wanted to take care of herself and send a few savings to her parents in her village.</p>



<p>She was not a Babysitter by choice. She has always wanted to be a sports athlete and represent her college at the state level.&nbsp;Finally, she wanted to join forces or the police as a career.</p>



<p>But her financial situation at home brought her to Delhi. She had to give up on her career to earn her living &amp; support her parents back home in the village.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Siso came across our representative and registered herself at <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong>.</p>



<p>She did not pay anyone anything to be a part of <strong>Helpers Near Me</strong>. She joined the platform willingly and free of cost.</p>



<p>After a few weeks of joining Helpers Near Me, she got connected to a family in South Delhi, met with them, and finally decided to work there. Currently, she still works with the same family as a Babysitter.</p>



<p>The family was accommodating enough to ensure she studied whenever she had time.</p>



<p>Now, Siso earns her living, sends money to her parents, and prepares for her dream career.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">But<strong> come to think of it:</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Is this the reality for many other Maids, Babysitters or other Workers?</li>



<li>How many babysitters do we know who have a decent family to live with, get some decent money, and are allowed to pursue their careers simultaneously?</li>



<li>Do they all work without the pressure of an Agent and Contractor?</li>



<li>How many get to take their full salary home and not share it with any agents in between?</li>
</ul>



<p>Today, the reality is that many workers end up paying a decent portion of their salary to Agents or Contractors in between.</p>

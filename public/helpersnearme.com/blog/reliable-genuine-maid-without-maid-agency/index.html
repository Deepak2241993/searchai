<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Have you ever tried a Maid Agency to find a Maid? Were they reliable? Or is it that you had no other option left?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What if there was an option?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try <a href="../../index.html">Helpers Near Me</a> today and find multiple legally verified Maids near you without the middlemen. Also, save on the commissions. </h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="../verification-for-maids-is-easy-now-its-online/index.html">Verification for Maids is easy in 2024. You can do it online. </a></h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>After trying all the options of finding a Maid or a Babysitter, there&#8217;s one last solution that most of us living in Metro cities try &#8211; reaching out to a Maid Agency!</p>



<p>And since the need to have a Maid at that stage is always urgent, we usually go ahead with the option that opens up in front of us.</p>



<p>So, what do you do when contacting a Maid Agency?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, you search for a &#8216;Maid Agency near me&#8217; online.</li>



<li>Or you can find contacts of 1-2 Maid Agencies through your references</li>



<li>Next, you call them and let them know&nbsp;your requirement</li>



<li>You ask a few fundamental questions on whether you can rely on them.</li>



<li>And most importantly, you check how long it would take them to help you hire a Maid.</li>
</ul>



<p>The challenge of finding <a href="../how-to-find-a-reliable-maid-online/index.html">a reliable Maid</a> is tough in bigger cities.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background">How much does a Maid cost in 2024? What is the right monthly salary or charge for hiring a Maid in any metro city of India in 2024?</h4>



<p>The monthly cost of hiring a Maid varies between ₹3,000 and ₹18,000, depending on the profile of the maid you hire.</p>



<p>The charges vary as per the hours of engagement. For a <strong>Maid who does the cleaning and housekeeping work twice a day, in all about 2-3 hours</strong>, the cost of hiring the maid varies between ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>



<p><strong>If you engage the same Maid for about half of the day (Part time Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Part time maid varies between ₹5,000 to ₹6,000.</p>



<p>In other cases where <strong>you want the Maid to cook at home</strong>, the cost of hiring the Cook varies between ₹7,000 to ₹9,000, depending on the cooking workload for the number of family members.</p>



<p><strong>If you want the Maid to be there with you for the whole day (Full Day Maid)</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full Day Maid ranges between ₹13,000 to ₹14,000.</p>



<p><strong>And if you are looking for a Full time Maid</strong>, the cost of hiring the Full time Maid varies between ₹17,000 to ₹18,000. Within this salary range, their primary task may vary from Cooking, Housekeeping, and Babysitting to Elder Care, but they are usually open to all the other household chores. </p>



<p>In some cases, the Full time Maids even charge between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, but they are usually the Maids who work with Expats and are far more experienced than those who haven&#8217;t worked for Expats earlier. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>And therefore, we don’t dwell much into the details of the Maid Agency as long as the problem gets solved for us, in any manner it may be.</p>



<p>Historically, Maid Agencies have existed for years in the cities.</p>



<p>Even though it costs a few thousand extras, some are good, offer great service, and are recognized by close references.</p>



<p>However, many maid agencies in almost every city in India are not operating legitimately.</p>



<p>No wonder why we keep hearing stories like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>The maid ran away with valuables.</em></li>



<li><em>The placement agency takes money, but the Maid flees</em></li>



<li><em>A maid service agency duped a doctor in Delhi</em></li>



<li><em>Citizens’ Experiences with Fake Agencies</em></li>
</ul>



<p>There are many such stories that we keep hearing from different parts of the city at different points in time.</p>



<p>These stories have become fairly common now.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you have gone past the stage of finding a maid through a maid agency, there are many further challenges you have to deal with.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">5 common challenges that most of us face with the Maid Agency</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>An element of doubt on their credibility &amp; reliability:</strong>&nbsp;Some common questions that occur to your mind are &#8211; How credible is the Maid Agency that you are dealing with? Will the Maid Agency ensure you get a reliable Maid? Can the Agent guarantee a safe recruit? Is it possible that the Maid Agency shares the past credentials of the Maid you hire? Would the Agency be there to help you if you face any problems?</li>



<li><strong>A full transparency issue</strong>: Will the Maid Agency be entirely transparent in its procedures? Will they share all the details of the Maid in absolute transparency?</li>



<li><strong>Question on how they treat the Maids?</strong> Does the Maid Agency treat their Maids with respect? How are they connected with the Maids? Are the Maids working with the agency willingly, or have they been forced to do the job of a Maid out of some liability or any hidden reason? Are the Maids being treated as Working Professionals?</li>



<li><strong>Uncertain financial transactions:</strong> Will the maid agency give the maid the right monthly salary? Would they provide the total amount that you give them, or would they charge a hefty commission from&nbsp;her&nbsp;every month’s salary? We often hear stories where the agencies charge exorbitant amounts of money from the customers but pay the maids in peanuts.</li>



<li><strong>And finally, are the Maids reliable enough?</strong> It is very natural to be concerned about the Maid’s reliability. Since the Maid will be with your family, children &amp; elders for an extended period and will have access to the entire house, the new person must be reliable enough, and we know her background in as much detail as possible.</li>
</ol>



<p>These challenges are always there, many before hiring a Maid and a few after.</p>



<p>Some doubts get answered; for the rest, most of us take a bit of risk and move on.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you find a Maid if you are not getting one easily?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is there any way to ensure the Maid Agency you are in contact with is legitimate?</h4>

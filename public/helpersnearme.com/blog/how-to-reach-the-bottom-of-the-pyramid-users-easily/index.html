<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Are the bottom of the pyramid users your target consumers? </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Do you think you are reaching out to them in the right way in 2024?</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try <a href="https://direct2worker.com/">Direct2Worker</a> Platform (D2W) today. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">D2W is India&#8217;s only direct-to-worker digital platform where you can advertise directly to the Bottom of the Pyramid Users in any part of India, that too, at an insanely low cost. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Google, Facebook &amp; YouTube seem obvious answers. However, they do not have enough variables to appropriately profile the Bottom of Pyramid Users in India. </h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://direct2worker.com/get-in-touch">Get in touch</a>. Ask for a demonstration today.</h4>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p class="has-cyan-bluish-gray-background-color has-background"><strong>Direct-to-Worker (D2W)</strong> is a digital platform with +1 million web pages where you can advertise your products/services directly to the bottom of the pyramid users. These pages are accessed directly by the Workers of India every day. Their monthly household income varies between ₹25,000 and ₹50,000, where the husband &amp; wife work in separate domains to earn their living. They are Domestic Workers, Office Workers, Drivers, Security Guards, Healthcare Workers, Store Workers, Restaurant Workers, Salon Workers, School Workers, Factory Workers, Construction Workers and Automotive Workers.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>You will find ample information on the fortune &amp; profits at India&#8217;s bottom of the pyramid. </p>



<p>However, you will not find enough information on how to reach the bottom of the pyramid users. </p>



<p>In the past, there have been some successful BOP initiatives in India, but almost all of them have primarily been offline.</p>



<p>And unless you have an on-ground infrastructure like <a href="https://www.hul.co.in/planet-and-society/case-studies/enhancing-livelihoods-through-project-shakti/">Project Shakti</a> of Unilever, it is almost impossible for you to take your brand story to the bottom of the pyramid users.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s digital age, the leading digital advertising platforms like Google, Facebook &amp; YouTube may seem like an obvious answer for reaching out to the bottom of the pyramid users.</p>



<p>However, you will surprised to know that they have multiple limitations for such a niche audience like the bottom of the pyramid users. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">11 limitations of Google, Facebook &amp; YouTube in 2024 for reaching out to niche audiences like the Bottom of the Pyramid Users in India:</h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Limited targeting option: </h4>



<p>You have limited targeting options for niche consumers. Especially for the bottom of the pyramid users, the leading digital platforms do not have enough variables to profile them appropriately.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ad exposure controls are limited: </h4>



<p>You have little control over your advertisement exposures. You will often find your ads appearing even on non-related pages.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Costly for competitive industries: </h4>



<p>If you operate in a competitive industry, your everyday fight for the best CPC &amp; CPM forces you to eventually pay more for your advertisements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Targeting accuracy is always questionable: </h4>



<p>Since there aren&#8217;t enough variables to profile the bottom of the pyramid user, the accuracy of the targeting is always doubtful. Mostly, you operate assuming your advertisement will reach the target audience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. There&#8217;s no guarantee of the placements of your ads at any particular space: </h4>



<p>The ad algorithms of the leading digital advertising platforms and targeting options can always be complex. It is always difficult for you, as advertisers, to precisely control who sees your ads, where they appear and at what time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Standard, limited or no value-adds: </h4>



<p>When you place your ads on such platforms, there&#8217;s not much of a value-add that you can do. They are usually plain, simple, and very structured formats for placing ads on them. Even if you have a decent advertising budget with you, beyond a point, you cannot add further value to your advertisements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Limited advertising space with constraints: </h4>



<p>There&#8217;s always just limited advertising space available on these platforms. Unlike the traditional mediums (Television, Newspapers or Radio), there&#8217;s nothing much you can do if you want to take more space for your brand.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. No control over negative comments: </h4>



<p>This is an important aspect. Your advertisements have a purpose, but you cannot avoid the comments accompanying them once they are live on these platforms. Positive comments are great, but the negative comments blur the purpose of your advertisements on these platforms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Ad blindness / Ad fatigue: </h4>



<p>Some ad formats, like Display Ads, are common online. The more we see them, the higher the likelihood of being blind to them. Furthermore, seeing the same ad repeatedly makes you bored &amp; annoyed with the content, leading to decreased engagement.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">10. Ad blocking options for the user: </h4>



<p>It is not valid as much in the case of the bottom of the pyramid users, but many of us use Ad blockers to block the ads we see while accessing these digital advertising platforms. This defeats the very purpose of placing the ads on these platforms.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">11. Click frauds: </h4>



<p>There is a risk of fraudulent clicks, especially on display ads, where bots or individuals generate clicks without intending to engage with the ad.</p>
